      <description> Stuart Halloway is a name in the Clojure community. I was rewatching one of his talks this morning and I thought some of you would enjoy it. Lots of gems on approaching programming and development.  Nothing radical or new here but lots of good stuff very well presented.  &amp;lt;iframe width=&amp;#34;560&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;315&amp;#34; src=&amp;#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OUZZKtypink&amp;#34; frameborder=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; allow=&amp;#34;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&amp;#34; allowfullscreen&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt; </description>

      <description>One of my pet annoyances is how code ecosystems have gotten more and more complex. Sometimes I think tool designers put together build systems to show how clever they are rather than to solve dependency problems as cleanly and simply as possible.  Over the break I wrote GitHub Org Explorer - a tool to help deal with GitHub classroom repositories. It worked but was using &amp;#34;basic&amp;#34; authentication where it sent a username and password with every request.</description>
