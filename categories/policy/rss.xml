      <title>NYSED says you don&#39;t need to know CS to teach CS</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/soce/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Mar 2023 15:11:38 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/soce/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The title might come of as hyperbole but it&amp;#39;s really true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ll explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A few years ago, NYSED created a certification area for computer
science. At Hunter, we&amp;#39;ve been running our certificate program for the
past three years and taking current teachers and qualifying them to
earn this new certification. This past Fall, NYSED finalized it&amp;#39;s
grandfathering position and just the other day it opened up the portal
to allow teachers to sign up. The grandfathering is called the SOCE -
Statement of Continued Eligibility (to teach computer science).  NYSED
also started an individual evaluation option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think the individual evaluation part is great. There are always
people who fall through the cracks. They are great teachers and really know
their stuff but they walked a different path. I have a friend who
taught CS for years but since he&amp;#39;s older he got his degrees before CS
was a thing. He also never worked for anyone else in tech even though he
created impressive software systems for his own company. In spite of
being super qualified, he&amp;#39;d never be approved by the state through
normal channels without having to take and pay for a whole bunch of
courses where he probably would know more than the instructors. Now,
with individual evaluation, he would have a chance to be fairly
judged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand the SOCE really concerns me. Not just the SOCE but
the fact that if you taught at least one CS class this past year (or
maybe within the past few years) and you filled out the form, you don&amp;#39;t
need to do anything else to teach CS for the next &lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; years. This is
extremely concerning. What&amp;#39;s equally concerning is that the state is
doing nothing to encourage teachers to earn real certification which
can be both time consuming and costly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve met a large number of NY teachers teaching CS. Mostly in NYC but
also from across the state. I&amp;#39;ve also evaluated hundreds of
applications to my certificate program. I&amp;#39;ve found that teachers fall
into the following categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teachers who really know CS. This is the extreme minority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teachers who have attended PDs or similar to learn to teach a
specific course or learn rudimentary programming. Some of these
teachers think they really know CS, some recognize that they&amp;#39;re
just following a script. Some want to learn more, some don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the second category that concerns me and that represents the
majority of teachers currently teaching CS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s look at the set of teachers who don&amp;#39;t want to learn more and
think that with their limited PD training that they&amp;#39;re doing right by
their students (voiceover: they&amp;#39;re probably not). These teachers can
continue doing what they&amp;#39;re doing for the next ten years. That&amp;#39;s a
generation of kids. As long as CS is untested (which is probably a
good thing) a teacher in this category can just dial it in while
focusing on their 4 other classes which have a high stakes exam. Even if
they&amp;#39;re not dialing it in, are they really doing right by the kids? If
I did short form PD to learn, let&amp;#39;s say physics, would I really be a
good physics teacher (voiceover: No).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The other category - teachers who do want to learn more and become
strong CS teachers. I&amp;#39;m hoping this is the majority of teachers
teaching CS but here the state is failing them and in turn failing
their students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Right now, Hunter&amp;#39;s program is the only advanced certificate program
running in the state. The state should be encouraging more
institutions to create programs. The state should also be working on
financial support and even release time for teachers who want to be
re-certified in CS. It&amp;#39;s a big ask to tell a teacher - it&amp;#39;s great that
you want to earn this new certification - now pay for a bunch of
graduate credits and take those classes during your non-existent free
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the state cared about bringing good CS Education to our students
they would have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encouraged more institutions to create certification programs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide financial support for teachers and if possible, release
time for teachers to take said programs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce the grandfathering window from 10 years to something more
like 5 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, they, with a bold bravado said &amp;#34;we recognize the importance of CS
so we&amp;#39;re creating a new certification area&amp;#34; and then quietly said when
nobody was looking &amp;#34;but nobody needs it for the next generation of
kids.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I know some teachers will be offended by this post but I&amp;#39;m hoping
teachers who do want to do it right didn&amp;#39;t miss the part about them
not getting the support. I&amp;#39;m with all of you, appreciate your efforts,
and wish the state (and city) was doing it right, enabling you to be
the best prepared teacher you can be for your kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand if I upset any teachers in that &amp;#34;we&amp;#39;re doing fine
even though we don&amp;#39;t know stuff&amp;#34; category, well, I&amp;#39;m good with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also know that some people will dismiss this saying that &amp;#34;that Z guy
runs the only cert program going right now, he clearly has a vested
interest in more people getting certified.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
True, one of the big reasons I came to Hunter was to lobby the state
to create a CS certification area and to build the programs. I&amp;#39;m proud
of that work. I&amp;#39;ve also, however  pushed for other programs to be
created. I also worked hard to successfully acquire funding which has
paid for the vast majority of the over 90 teachers that are in or have
completed our program. Finally, as I&amp;#39;m leaving Hunter after this
semester, so I really don&amp;#39;t have any skin in this
particular game any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, that&amp;#39;s my take. I get that teachers should file for the SOCE - no
reason to individually &amp;#34;be the hero&amp;#34; and the state will basically
ignore the issue for the next decade. After that, who knows but in the
meantime, our kids deserve better.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Public Education - Which side are you on?</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/which-side/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2022 08:20:41 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
My feeds have been inundated with post after post dealing with teacher
burnout, teacher shortages, government attacks on teachers and public
schools. In response to one video, a friend of mine commented:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is going to be a crazy summer and fall. I wonder if we are
witnessing the end of public education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Teaching was always a high attrition profession but given the stress
teachers have been under since the pandemic started it&amp;#39;s no surprise
that teachers who can are leaving in droves. As much as society says
that teachers are essential, the fact is that society never puts its
money where its mouth is. Teachers have been underpaid,
under resourced, and overworked for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The pandemic just brought this out and accelerated it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the same time, young people are realizing that teaching is
becoming less and less viable as a profession. Schools of education
face declining enrollment. It doesn&amp;#39;t help that schools of education
by and large have poor reputations with the public and state
requirements for teaching force those interested to jump through far
too many hoops and the hoops won&amp;#39;t help them if the candidate decides
teaching isn&amp;#39;t for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The fact is that teaching and public school teaching in particular has
been under attack for decades and we might be rapidly approaching a
tipping point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This means that if you haven&amp;#39;t, it&amp;#39;s time to pick a side. Are you for
public education and if so, what are you doing about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The right has been attacking public schools for as long as I can
remember. Voucher bills, supporting charters that are terrific ways of
skimming money from public schools while avoiding accountability and
most currently legislation to control schools in ways that, quite
frankly are so vile I won&amp;#39;t dive into specifics here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The left isn&amp;#39;t much better. We had Arne Duncan claiming that Hurricane
Katrina was the best thing for New Orleans schools since it allowed
for privatization. Rahm Emanuel has also been no friend to public
education. In NY we had twelve years of Bloomberg who ran as a
republican but aligns with democrats destroying neighborhood schools
and pushing private charters and we also most recently had Andrew
Cuomo who is also no friend to public schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I usually post about CS Education so why am I writing about this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Because far too often the CS Community is just happy to be in the game
and ignores the collateral damage to public education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I wrote a little about this back in 2017 when Code.org decided to partner with
the College board (&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cs-ed-in-bed-college-board/&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). Why was a CS Ed organiztion essentially
pushing a new, additional, and worthless standardized exams on to
eighth graders. Now, I&amp;#39;m sure that the people at Code.org don&amp;#39;t agree
with me that the College Board has too much power and is harmful and
this helped them get in the room but I disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another great example is when code.org, districts, curriculum
providers and everyone else who&amp;#39;s rolling out short form PD claiming
that &amp;#34;they&amp;#39;ve trained teachers to teach CS&amp;#34; and that those teachers
are ready to go. I&amp;#39;d like to believe all of this is well meaning and I
do believe most of it is but it does real damage to the profession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We also see this when we see best practices preached from elite
private institutions. Practices that would never work under urban
public school challenges but that then is what the public school
teacher is held up to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We also see this when we work for said institutions or companies who
pay lip service to public education by throwing out some crumbs. Prior
to my pushing things at Google NY, urban public schools weren&amp;#39;t on
their map. They talked the diversity game but didn&amp;#39;t walk the
walk. They&amp;#39;re doing better now but still have so far to go and to be
honest, as an institution I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39; doing better. Rather,
they just have some individuals in places where they can do some good
and they&amp;#39;re doing it. What happens when they leave?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you work at one of these big companies or at an &amp;#34;elite&amp;#34; institution
education are you just collecting your check to maintain the status
quo or are you working to make things better in public education -
particularly for the most vulnerable and most undeserved?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you are working at said company and are trying to do good, is it
enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
No it&amp;#39;s not  and I know that might make some people uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you&amp;#39;re working at random big company or &amp;#34;elite&amp;#34; school and run a
program to provide an opportunity for a handful of &amp;#34;those&amp;#34; kids. No,
it&amp;#39;s not enough. My friend Leigh Ann Delyser talks about  &lt;a href=&#34;https://csedpodcast.org/blog/season2_episode5/&#34;&gt;Systemic
Change&lt;/a&gt;. If we just work around the edges, just run our little
programs, in the long run, how much are we changing. If we&amp;#39;re not
working to change the systems we&amp;#39;re just going to remain on the
treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of my jobs at Hunter was to create an honors CS
program. One of the things I insisted on was that I have a chance to
move the opportunities I created to the greater Hunter population. If
I was only affecting my 30 - 60 kids a year nothing was really
changing and when I leave Hunter it would probably be all gone. That&amp;#39;s
not meaningful change. On the other hand, if I can create something
that stick and positively affects all Hunter CS students, then we&amp;#39;ve
moved the needle even if only by a bit,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I for one left Wall Street over thirty years ago because I found the
work unfulfilling and didn&amp;#39;t believe in the ethics of the system. I
just tried teaching on a lark and it stuck. I went into public
education because I believe in it and its importance and I remain in
public ed to this day. I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;ve succeeded in any systemic
change but I think that I&amp;#39;ve at least been a part of it in my small
corner of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As many of you know, I&amp;#39;ll talk shop with anyone but I also draw a
line. I&amp;#39;ll talk but I&amp;#39;m not going to work to help you if I think
you&amp;#39;re doing harm. I&amp;#39;ve talked, for instance with people from the
Success Academy charter schools but I&amp;#39;d never work with them, at least
not unless they seriously changed their practices and made amends for
past damage. To quote Carl Fox from Wall Street: &amp;#34;I don&amp;#39;t go to bed
with no whore, and I don&amp;#39;t wake up with no whore. That&amp;#39;s how I live
with myself. What about you?&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I titled this post &amp;#34;Which side are you on?&amp;#34; That&amp;#39;s from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Which_Side_Are_You_On%3F&#34;&gt;song&lt;/a&gt; by
Florence Reece about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_County_War&#34;&gt;Harlan County War&lt;/a&gt; during the labor
movement. Just like then, it&amp;#39;s time to pick sides now. Do you believe
in public education and do you think it&amp;#39;s important and what are you
going to do about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Below is a cover of the song by the Weavers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ll leave you with one
last story. One of my personal heroes, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-01-30-pete-seeger/&#34;&gt;Pete Seeger&lt;/a&gt; was a member of the
Weavers. Pete left the group in 1958. The rest of the group had
decided to do a cigarette ad, something that Pete disagreed with. He
apparently was concerned with both selling out and the health
issues. He left the group although he did fulfill all outstanding
contractual commitments. He relayed the story during an interview. It
went something like: the band said they wanted to do this cigarett
ad. I objected. They said we needed the money. I said &amp;#34;we don&amp;#39;t need
it that much.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Something to think about.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Censorship, TOS, and a slippery slope</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/censorship/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 14 Jan 2021 14:14:14 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>
&lt;p&gt;
Lots of chatter with Donald Trump being kicked off
platforms left and right. On the one hand we&amp;#39;re getting a lot of &amp;#34;it&amp;#39;s
censorship, it&amp;#39;s unust&amp;#34; and on the other side we have &amp;#34;it&amp;#39;s about
time.&amp;#34; I&amp;#39;m of course in the &amp;#34;it&amp;#39;s about time&amp;#34; category but even so,
there&amp;#39;s a cause for concern and a lot of meat for a discussion on tech
policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What makes this interesting discussion fodder is that Trump was
removed from different levels of the internet. First you&amp;#39;ve got actual
applications like Twitter and Facebook. Next you&amp;#39;ve got the Play and
Apple stores and finally, you&amp;#39;ve got AWS which provided cloud services
to Parler. At each level the removal of Trump and others inciting hate
and violence have different ramifications and nuances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Facebook and Twitter
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First let&amp;#39;s look at Facebook and Twitter. On the one hand this is an
easy one. They&amp;#39;re not government agencies - they&amp;#39;re private
companies so the first amendment doesn&amp;#39;t apply. Next, were they
denying service to Trump? No - he had an account on both
services. What did happen is that he violated terms of service. While
I&amp;#39;d never follow Trump, I did follow an account that tweeted his
tweets. The account was set up to see if it would be suspended - guess
what, it was - more than once. This isn&amp;#39;t discrimination or
censorship, this is bouncing the unruly patron at the bar or, dare I
say removing the person who refuses to wear a mask from your store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you&amp;#39;re one of those free market regulation bad people I don&amp;#39;t want
to hear it. In this case, the market did indeed decide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is, however, a big problem and that&amp;#39;s the fact that Twitter,
Facebook and a few other players have so much power. You could argue
they&amp;#39;re de facto monopolies. For years they willingly amiplified
Trump&amp;#39;s lies and now overnight removed him. That&amp;#39;s a huge amount of
power for a company to have. People like me have felt that for years,
Facebook and Twitter have been behaving irresponsibly and as of last
week people on the right feel that way and Dorsey and Zuck can&amp;#39;t be
voted out of office. One can of course argue &amp;#34;The Market&amp;#34; but it&amp;#39;s not
that simple with the market being dominated by a small number of
players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m doubting that calls to split up the tech giants will be helpful. I
don&amp;#39;t know if we&amp;#39;re better off now as opposed to before AT&amp;amp;T split and
I&amp;#39;m not sure that strongarm regulation is the answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Enforcing open proticols, APIs and standards would probably help a
great deal but in any event, we do have a problem with big tech but
it&amp;#39;s not what the right is crying about now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
The stores and AWS
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next we have the app stores removing Parler. I&amp;#39;m guessing this is also
a violation of TOS issue but there&amp;#39;s another issue here which is
liability. Is Google or Apple liable or responsible for something on
an application they distribute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Related but different is AWS - are they responsible for things that
occur on their servers even though it&amp;#39;s Parler or whomever creates and
runs the applications running on the Amazon Cloud?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Napster enters the chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not exactly the same, but similar. For you youngsters, Napster was one
of the early file sharing services. It was basically an IRC based
setup to locate mp3 files in order to facilitate their
transfer. Napster never hosted any of the files in question but the
music industry went hard after them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even earlier you had alt.pictures.binaries. Back in the day they said
that people came to the internet for email but stayed for &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet&#34;&gt;Usenet&lt;/a&gt;
news. Basically, they were forums or chatrooms on just about any
topic. I of course subscribed to comp.lang.c,
alt.sports.basketball.nyknicks and a bunch of others. You connected to
your news server to retrieve and post messages and messages were
transferred periodically between servers. Originally using UUCP which
had computers dialing each other up on set schedules but later over
the internet. The servers didn&amp;#39;t own or even know what was in the
messages. They just stored and forwarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The question came up with binary groups - alt.pictures.binaries in
particular. Groups like alt.pictures.binaries would contain messages
with encoded images. A single image wouldn&amp;#39;t fit into a message and
messages were ascii so binary data couldn&amp;#39;t be directly sent. Images
were encode using a program called &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uuencoding&#34;&gt;uuencode&lt;/a&gt; and split into a bunch of
messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As one might expect, the binary groups ended up a place to traffic
adult and/or illegal material. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The question was were the server&amp;#39;s owners responsible? They didn&amp;#39;t
create or own the posted material. They probably weren&amp;#39;t even aware it
was on their servers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a question cloud hosts like AWS have to consider on top of
public perception and just doing what&amp;#39;s right (whatever that is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A final note on this is that Net Neutrality, while maybe not applying
in this specific instance harps on the same questions - with net
neutrality, ISPS must treat all network traffic the same. Without it
they are free to do what they want - they could slow down or block
services they don&amp;#39;t want to support. Not the same since cloud servers
are not ISPs but certainly similar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Lots of meat here and there&amp;#39;s no clear cut right thing to do. Should
the market decide? Is regulation needed? If so how much. Should it
just be at the application level or how about the cloud? The Net
Neutrality issue isn&amp;#39;t that old but when it came up nobody was talking
about the cloud and app stores as gatekeepers didn&amp;#39;t exist. Add to
that the fact that our elected officials are, let us say, not the most
up on modern tech and tech issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I can see a lot of rich discussion coming out of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>School leadership and COVID, or not</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/covid-leadership/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2020 09:48:51 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/covid-leadership/</guid>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;
Teachers are back and students will soon follow either in person or
remote. In person means in person one or two days a week with the
rest of the time from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This of course shows horrible leadership. It fails in terms of
education, safety and even freeing up parents to get back to
work. After all, if your kid is only in school one or two days a week
it hardly allows you to get back to your own full time job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course the plan gets worse. It&amp;#39;s optimized to provide the worst
possible educational experience. I won&amp;#39;t rehash the plans here but
it&amp;#39;s looking to increase the teachers workload tremendously while at
the same time killing continuity for the students (unless of course
the DOE can hire thousands of extra teachers and somehow arrange for
them to mind meld with the  main teacher). I&amp;#39;m not going to hash out
the details here but they&amp;#39;re easy enough to find on the interwebs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now in terms of leadership I&amp;#39;m not writing about De Blasio or
Carranza. We all know they&amp;#39;re absolutely horrible. It&amp;#39;s hard to
believe Carranza was actually a classroom teacher at one point and
while I&amp;#39;m no fan of Bloomberg on education at least you could say that
he had a vision, albeit an incorrect one of applying business sense to
schools and followed it while De Blasio is tone deaf, arrogant and
clueless which could make him more dangerous. I&amp;#39;m talking about in
school leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What did schools do? Well some tried to make the best of a bad
situation. They recognized that the Mayor&amp;#39;s hybrid model was bunk and
while safe full time in person is clearly the best choice, fully
remote, even with its difficulties and limitations  would be more
sound than hybrid. Add to that the fact that if a school had to go
remote midstream you&amp;#39;d be set even further back &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-reference&#34;&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;footnote-reference-1&#34; href=&#34;#footnote-1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. These schools
decided to basically set up remote from in school. Students who wanted
to or had to go to school would be sent to specific parts of the
school where they would receive the same remote instruction as their
classmates. This would accommodate students who couldn&amp;#39;t work from
home while allowing for a sensible overall schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sounds like good leadership to me and in some cases it is. On the
other hand, in some cases you have to  dig deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first question has to do with the student pods. Can they be set up
safely. What about entering and leaving? Bathrooms? Lunch? I&amp;#39;m
guessing some schools have a good plan in place but I&amp;#39;ve also heard
teachers refer to their upcoming student learning pods as &amp;#34;deathpods.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The next question has to do with teachers working from the building or
from home. The DOE decreed that unless you get a medical excemption
you &lt;strong&gt;have&lt;/strong&gt; to work from school. Who cares if you&amp;#39;re meeting students
in person or not, you &lt;strong&gt;have&lt;/strong&gt; to be there. This was ridiculous. I&amp;#39;ve
already written about it - &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/scared-teachers-scared-students/&#34;&gt;scared teachers can&amp;#39;t teach&lt;/a&gt;. This is where
leadership kicks in. I&amp;#39;ve heard through the grapevine that some
schools had teachers working from home without DOE permission. Sounds
like good leadership to me - trust your people to do the job and do
the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Recently, the DOE backpedaled and gave schools the ability to allow
teachers to work from home without medical excemptions so long as it
worked within their COVID plans. Looks like some schools are jumping
on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunately, others aren&amp;#39;t. I&amp;#39;ve heard of principals that are
setting up their schools to be &amp;#34;remote from school&amp;#34; but requiring all
teachers show up in person even though they clearly don&amp;#39;t need all of
them on site. This is the type of &amp;#34;leadership&amp;#34; I&amp;#39;ve come to expect
from many of the Bloomberg era principals I&amp;#39;ve met - you know, the
ones that barely taught for a cup of coffee. Insisting that teachers
brave the subways and share facilities like bathrooms only to spend
the day teaching in isolation serves no purpose other than to exert
power over them. If a teacher is teaching all remote and isn&amp;#39;t needed
for the pods, let them teach from home. They&amp;#39;ll be more comfortable
and thus more effective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It sounds like some principals are being true educators and leaders in
these times but many are not and in these times when we can&amp;#39;t count on
our elected officials or his appointees to do the right thing, we need
all our principals to step up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Footnotes
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr class=&#34;footnotes-separatator&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnote-definitions&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnote-definition&#34;&gt;
&lt;sup id=&#34;footnote-1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#footnote-reference-1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnote-body&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I&amp;#39;m only talking here about the general population at
the high school level. I don&amp;#39;t claim to know the best format for the
younger grades and accomodating special needs students are a whole
different kettle of fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Reopening Schools - de Blasio and Carranza throw kids and teachers under the bus.</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/reopening-schools/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Jul 2020 08:18:21 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/reopening-schools/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday, Bill de Blasio and Richard Carranza unveiled their open the
schools in the fall plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The plan is perfectly consistent with de Blasio and Carranza&amp;#39;s
education policies and efforts in general - tone deaf, ineffective,
and in this case, unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I know we were told that part of this came from survey results but we
all know that surveys are super easy to fix. I mean, ask any teacher
or parent &amp;#34;do you want schools to be open and in person in the Fall?&amp;#34;
and everyone will say &amp;#34;yes.&amp;#34; Of course, there&amp;#39;s the implication that
it&amp;#39;s safe and I bet that part didn&amp;#39;t make it in to the surveys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I didn&amp;#39;t watch the news conference live, but I was told that while
principals, parents, and children were mentioned over and over as
consulted constituents when forming the plan, somehow teachers never
came up. Typical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The basics of the plan is that students could go all remote or hybrid
and under the hybrid model, they&amp;#39;d be in the schools some days and not
others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Does this address health concerns? Doubtful. They&amp;#39;re talking about a
third to half the students attending at a time. Take a look at any
school on opening and closing - it&amp;#39;s wall to wall from the school to
the subway. It&amp;#39;s a mess. Many schools are already split schedule -
they have their kids entry and egress staggered into halves or thirds
and the beginning and end of days there are &lt;strong&gt;STILL&lt;/strong&gt; wall to wall for
blocks not to mention the subway platforms and cars. Even 1/3 isn&amp;#39;t
going to do it and the more you stagger, the more you lengthen the
school days and this affects both staff and families. What good is
having a kid go to school so you can work if they don&amp;#39;t start until
mid day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s assume, although I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a safe assumption, that you
can get the kids to and from school safety. How big are the
classrooms? I heard that some Stuy teacher&amp;#39;s measured them and they
could safely accommodate something like 9 -  12 people. That&amp;#39;s in line
with what DbD said but what about transfer between classes? Some
schools - particularly those in converted spaces have TINY halls or
limited stairwells. What about bathrooms? None of this has been
addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about cleaning? Teachers have regularly begged for basic
supplies. Schools go without necessities like toilet paper and the
Mayor&amp;#39;s saying that we&amp;#39;ll have sufficient masks and cleaning supplies?
Good luck with that! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even if we have the supplies, will they be used and used correctly and
often enough? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about compliance? For years, schools had a &amp;#34;no hats&amp;#34; policy but
rarely are there no hats. Even when the policy works, usually it&amp;#39;s a
result of teachers continually asking students to remove their
hats. How did those cell phone bans work? Do we really believe we can
get 100% compliance from students, teachers, and staff? What about the
younger grades? We really expect them to comply with adult
protocols?????&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even if everything is implemented, will it keep everyone safe?
Unlikely. Professional and big time college sports have extreme
incentive to &amp;#34;open up&amp;#34;, boatloads of money and everyone pulling in the
same direction. They test all the time, have all the space they need
and can implement whatever protocols they want. Even with all this we
keep hearing about new cases in those populations. If they can&amp;#39;t do it
how can underfunded schools?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With all of this, even if it&amp;#39;s safe and even if schools can manage
reasonable schedules, students will only be going to school a couple
of times a week - will this really help parents? Maybe not. I remember
when we had Batya. We were looking for child care for just a couple of
days a week. Five days was easy, no days was easy but just a couple -
not so much. What about the shifted days? Large schools might need 4
shifts. Kids either start and end super early or super late. Will that
help parents who work &amp;#34;regular time&amp;#34; jobs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, let&amp;#39;s get to the education side of things. High school
teachers teach five classes a day. Around 34 kids in a class. Given
room size restrictions that  means we have to split into threes. If
one teacher has to deal with this then it&amp;#39;s a HUGE increase in
work. If kids come to school on different days they&amp;#39;ll get different
live lessons - for each class teachers will have to make at least one
in person lesson and at least one corresponding remote lesson and I&amp;#39;m
over simplifying. Since you&amp;#39;re now &amp;#34;teaching&amp;#34; 10 or 15 classes instead
of 5 I don&amp;#39;t see how you can meet with them in person and deliver
synchronous remote instruction which means you&amp;#39;re only actually
interacting with your students once or twice a week and there&amp;#39;s no way
teachers will be able to actually develop materials, assess students,
and maintain meaningful contact unless someone finds a whole lot of
hours to the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, if the teacher just does the in person and another
or other teachers do the remote you&amp;#39;ll have multiple teachers teaching
a single class without any real coordination  - this is yet another
recipe for disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I get it - we all want to get back to normal. I want to be with my
students but I want to be with them safely. I also get that some
students are not doing well in isolation and that remote school is
both less effective than in person and a hardship all around but when
we open it has to make sense both in terms of safety and in terms of
education. de Blasio and Carranza&amp;#39;s plan is neither.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why are police held to such a lower standard than teachers?</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teachers-police-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 12:36:04 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teachers-police-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
My friend Neal Zupancic, actually former student, friend, and long
time teacher Neal Zupancic posted this on Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s 100% spot on. I&amp;#39;d add my two cents but Neal captured it better
than I ever could. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Take a minute to read it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In my ten years of teaching, I&amp;#39;ve dealt with a number of situations
that could have potentially turned dangerous.  I&amp;#39;ve taught in public
schools and private; urban schools and rural.  I have de-escalated
every last one of those situations.  I have never once used force.  I
once broke up a fist fight using only my voice and my presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve never felt the need to announce that before, because it&amp;#39;s just a
part of my profession.  Every teacher knows it and most of the public
knows as well.  And there are teachers who have been in far more
dangerous situations than I have.  Teachers who deal with gang
activity, drug dealers, kids who bring weapons to school with the
intent to use them, kids who fight and don&amp;#39;t necessarily stop when you
show up.  I know teachers who have been assaulted by students.  I know
teachers who have been threatened by students, including with deadly
weapons.  Every teacher is expected to deal with every one of these
situations without using force or violence.  Some of us are
well-trained, and some of us are thrown in and just go on instinct.
But we de-escalate.  We calm.  We soothe.  We help.  We repair and
restore the community.  We heal people.  We build an environment in
which those we are responsible for can thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I keep seeing people ask &amp;#34;who would want to be a cop if you could get
fired for doing your job?&amp;#34;  But literally any teacher could do that
job without killing people.  Literally any teacher would have had the
patience to talk George Floyd into getting into that police car
instead of tossing him on the ground and murdering him.  Literally any
teacher would have let Rayshard Brooks get away rather than shooting
him dead, knowing that the system would provide accountability for his
resisting arrest and that you didn&amp;#39;t have to be his executioner.
Literally any teacher knows that by the time you are in a power
struggle with a student, you have already lost.
Literally. any. teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I hear these cops whining on social media and it sickens me.  They
wouldn&amp;#39;t last a day teaching.  And of course we see that when we see
how often cops in schools arrest kids for routine behavior problems
that teachers could have solved peacefully.  We already know cops
can&amp;#39;t handle teenagers without resorting to force.  We already know
cops in schools exacerbate racism and inequality - just like they do
outside of schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And the reason for that is that we fire teachers who can&amp;#39;t control
their tempers.  We fire teachers who use force rather than let them
stay on the job and keep escalating that force until they kill
someone.  We &lt;strong&gt;weed out&lt;/strong&gt; the bad apples.  And no teacher would ever
dream of protesting or walking off the job in support of someone who
got fired for assaulting a student.  Are you kidding me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m reading posts in teacher&amp;#39;s groups about going back to school in
fall - or in some cases, in July or August to extend the school year -
without adequate protection from coronavirus, without enough room in
their halls and classrooms to socially distance, without funding for
hand sanitizer or wipes or masks, without training or PD on blended or
distance learning, without promised raises because municipalities have
lost tax revenue because of corona - and then I see cops who walk
around in body armor and work for departments that own tanks, whining
about how hard their jobs are because they&amp;#39;re finally catching flak
for shooting people, and it&amp;#39;s like - what are your priorities?  Where
is your perspective?  What kind of society do you expect to raise into
the next generation when you&amp;#39;ll fund a militarized occupying force
with impunity for homicide but you won&amp;#39;t buy teachers masks and
sanitizer during a pandemic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And teachers never, ever, ever whine like these cops do.  My
&lt;strong&gt;students&lt;/strong&gt; don&amp;#39;t even whine like these cops do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Seriously - where do they find these people?  Our job is a hundred
times harder and if we mess up even once the way cops do every day,
we&amp;#39;re out in a heartbeat.  And yet if I whined about it the way cops
whine about it, people would say &amp;#34;hey man, maybe you should stfu and
find a different job.&amp;#34;  And they&amp;#39;d be right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So to all the cops out there who think they have it rough: You ain&amp;#39;t
nothing compared to a teacher.  STFU and find a different job.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Future consequences of today&#39;s grading policies</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/grading-consequences/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 07:08:12 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
How are we going to deal with grades? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This has garnered a lot of attention since COVID-19 struck.  Over on
the AP side people wonder if colleges will give credit? Do the tests
mean anything? What about the material they won&amp;#39;t be testing? We also
have had standardized tests canceled and a variety of grading
policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m going to stay away from AP this time around - you all know my
feelings about the college board. I will leave you with a couple of
good posts though that share many of my views (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/views/2020/05/26/ap-courses-do-not-deserve-college-credit-opinion&#34;&gt;AP Courses don&amp;#39;t
deserve college credit&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&#34;https://jd2718.org/2020/05/18/retiring-advanced-placement/&#34;&gt; Retiring Advanced Placement&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The bottom line is that student and teachers lives have been severely
disrupted  since early March. In NYC public schools that means three
to four months which is a considerable chunk of the semester. In
college the percent is slightly less but it&amp;#39;s still a good chunk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some students have done fine but many have had difficulty and I&amp;#39;d
venture a guess to say most won&amp;#39;t end the semester in the same place
they would have under normal circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about this as a result of Hunter&amp;#39;s policy and I
don&amp;#39;t really have a good answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hunter decided that instructors would award grades as they normally
would. Each instructor would follow their own counsel on how to
grade. Should they be super lenient due to circumstances? Extra hard
because of perceived cheating (don&amp;#39;t get me started on this), same old
same old or some other method. Once grades were awarded, students have
the ability to change any or all classes to pass/fail. Normally if a
student takes a class pass/fail it can&amp;#39;t be used as a prerequisite or
to fill a major requirement but for this past semester, it can. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Overall I like this policy - it gives the students most of the control
and they don&amp;#39;t have to decide on anything until after the fact. The
bad part comes in though with the any passed class counting as a
prerequisite of for the major. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s say I have a student in CS1 who was doing well but really
struggled at the end after we went remote. Maybe that student was
doing A or B work up to the switch but basically got nothing out of
the rest of the semester. I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to fail the student. Under
normal circumstances, we make the false assumption that the grade is
entirely the result of the student and factors surrounding the
student&amp;#39;s environment. Even if that assumption were 100% true the Covid
Curve Ball was not the students fault and the negative impact to their
studies could not only be due to their circumstances but also due to
actions of the college or the way the instructor reacted to the
circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With Hunter&amp;#39;s policy, I could award any passing grade - even a D and
the student could convert it to a Pass and move on to CS2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The danger here is that the student might not be prepared for CS2. We
cover memory pointers, memory management, and classes at the end of
CS1. So much of CS2 is built on pointer based programs that a student
who missed out on that in CS1 is going to struggle mightily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You might say that the kid could have retaken CS1 but there&amp;#39;s a wrench
in the works. If the kid failed CS1 they could retake it. With a Pass
they can&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A student could, with the permission of some instructor audit the
missed parts of CS1 or self study but we know that won&amp;#39;t always
happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The alternative is to award a failing grade to the student which would
then hurt their GPA and force them to retake the entire course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You might say that the school could just adjust the curricula for next
year but it&amp;#39;s not that simple. In high school most students progress
in lockstep. In college there&amp;#39;s more variation. Next semester&amp;#39;s CS2
will have students who completed CS1 this past semester under the
cloud of COVID-19, students who completed it on the Fall, some from
summer and some from other places. This is where curricular
consistency is somewhat more important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I do like Hunter&amp;#39;s policy and I do think it&amp;#39;s on the side of the
student but I&amp;#39;m not happy about this loophole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This probably won&amp;#39;t affect a huge number of students but some will
fall through the cracks. As I said, I don&amp;#39;t have a good answer but it
is something I&amp;#39;m really concerned about.&lt;/p&gt;

Preamble
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve never accepted a guest post before but when my friend and long
time colleague JonAlf Dyrland-Weaver said he had something to say I
was all for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
JonAlf&amp;#39;s one of the best teachers I know - he started at Brandeis HS and
has been at Stuy forever. Really sharp guy, great teacher, and really
perceptive. When he has something to say it&amp;#39;s 100% worth listening
to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To JonAlf - since I know this is one of my blog posts you&amp;#39;ll actually
read - you should set up a blog of your own. The community would be
all the better for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, educators across the nation are
adapting to remote learning. I’ve watched my colleagues work hard
putting together plans on how to deliver content, engage students and
assess their learning. Some, like myself, are combining multiple tools
in order to achieve these goals while others are using a single
platform for it all. I count myself lucky that the administration in
my school has given its teachers the leeway to select their own tools
instead of forcing a single platform on us. Last week, as I was
thinking through what my plan was going to be, a particular thought
kept nagging at me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-4&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-4&#34;&gt;
How much of this work will be seen?
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-4&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We are facing an amazing opportunity in the world of education. Think
of how many lessons, worksheets, notes, examples, etc. are being put
out in some electronic form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-5&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-5&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Students will (hopefully) have access to the materials for their
classes, and teachers in the same school may also be able to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-6&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-6&#34;&gt;
How much of this work will never be seen?
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-6&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about the teacher three states away that’s struggling to find good resources or new problems?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-7&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-7&#34;&gt;
How much of this work will never be seen?
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-7&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about the student in a different district, perhaps one that has
shut down entirely, who just wants to learn and do some work in order
to help fill the days?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-8&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-8&#34;&gt;
How much of this work will never be seen?
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-8&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The internet gives us the ability to put all of these resources out
there to the public, and it pains me to think about how much of this
work is going to be hidden behind one platform or another. So many of
the educational technologies make it very easy to post work for your
class and very hard, if not impossible, to share it with other people
(you’re school doesn’t also have a license for XYZ?, sorry).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, there are many teachers out there that have no choice, they
are being mandated to use whatever the school decrees. There are
others, perhaps the less technically savvy, that are going to use
whatever they can get trained on quickly. We’re all running a 2 minute
drill and working with what we have. I get that, and it is not a
teacher’s job to provide materials for everyone. That being said, If
you have the knowhow, or would like to learn, there are ways to make
your work publicly available. Last summer Mike and I ran a session at
the CSTA conference on using GitHub for just this purpose, and hope to
run a workshop on it this summer (For those interested, I made a brief
tutorial about how to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve got a computer graphics class here:

      <title>Why the Thomas Friedman&#39;s editorial on the College Board&#39;s Two Codes left me concerned</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/college-boards-two-codes/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Feb 2019 10:20:19 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/college-boards-two-codes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
There was some buzz over &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/opinion/college-board-sat-ap.html&#34;&gt;this editorial&lt;/a&gt; about the College Board last
week. The two codes every child needs - Coding and the US
Constitution? Who could argue with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m not going to disagree. Civics and CS are important and can&amp;#39;t wait
until college. The thing that left me chilled though was that nobody&amp;#39;s
paying attention to the fact that the College Board - a private entity
with its own interests has so much influence over American education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the piece, Friedman states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So rather than have SAT exams and Advanced Placement courses based on things that you cram for and forget, they are shifting them, where they can, to promote the “two codes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 2016, the College Board completely revamped its approach toA.P. computer science courses and exams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Nothing wrong here but the AP program is supposed to offer &amp;#34;college
level&amp;#34; work in high school. Back when the program started, from 
best I can figure, they offered exams based on courses that were
essentially HS implementations of college classes. Now they&amp;#39;re
flipping the script. They&amp;#39;re dictating what they think should be
taught at the high school level and, oh by the way, it&amp;#39;s college level
because it has the AP designation. The editorial goes into some
details. Now, I&amp;#39;m not against what they&amp;#39;re doing with AP US Gov, it
sounds like a really good idea. I&amp;#39;m against their overall influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The biggest concern I had though was with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides revamping the government course and the exam on that subject, Coleman and Sanford in 2014 made a staple of the regular SAT a long reading comprehension passage from one of the founding documents, such as the Constitution, or another important piece of democracy, like a great presidential speech. That said to students and teachers something the SAT had never dared say before: Some content is disproportionately more powerful and important, and if you prepare for it you will be rewarded on the SAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we put this on the SAT, schools will teach it so the kids will do
better the SAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This should be chilling to everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
No, I&amp;#39;m not against the details but it&amp;#39;s frightening to have a private
entity with so much influence on public policy like
education. Ultimately, it can&amp;#39;t be good. Just because what the College
Board&amp;#39;s pushing in terms of civics jives with me doesn&amp;#39;t mean they
should be able to influence and manipulate curriculum across the
nation to such a degree. The College Board is pretty much accountable
to nobody. As long as students are told to take AP classes and the
SAT, particularly with politicians and boards of education agreeing to
pay the college board with taxpayers money, the public has very little
say. Sure, more better civics and CS is good but who&amp;#39;s to say the next
initiative will be in the public&amp;#39;s interest?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The same can be said for any of the major education players - for and
non profit alike both in and out of CS. We have to be more aware,
vigilant, and vocal when the power players accomplish things by being
the 800 pound gorilla even when we agree with what some of those
things are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a big reason why I frequently speak out against the College
Board and other power players, some of whom I greatly like, respect,
and admire, and feel that others should feel obligated to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
