Let me be clear. To me a Drag and Drop language can certainly be a real language and many are. I also think they&amp;#39;re terrific when used correctly. I just think they&amp;#39;re frequently misapplied in later grades.  No, I&amp;#39;m talking about people asking things like &amp;#34;Why do we have to use Java in our class, why can&amp;#39;t we use a real language like __.</description>
