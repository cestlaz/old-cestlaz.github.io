      <title>Trends In Professional Development in CS - it&#39;s not all good</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/trends-in-pd/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
My friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mrtomocon/status/1486012499304587269&#34;&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt; tweeted earlier which led me to &lt;a href=&#34;https://csforall.medium.com/virtual-professional-development-is-here-to-stay-d2a3888f2d1a &#34;&gt;this piece&lt;/a&gt; on trends in
CS professional development (PD). Tom&amp;#39;s tweet was talking about virtual vs
in person PD so I initially thought I&amp;#39;d write about that and PD in
general but the article actually led to some deeper issues with PD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The article talks about PD being focussed on specific units or
modules, narrowing to more popular offerings and also becoming less
localized. This led me to think about a real issue with CS PD that a
few of us have been harping on for years. The &lt;strong&gt;VAST&lt;/strong&gt; majority of CS PD
is provided for by &amp;#34;content providers&amp;#34; - people with a product to
sell. That might be a curriculum, a technical platform, or both but
something to sell. It&amp;#39;s not just CS knowledge and how to teach
it. I include organizations like code.org in this bucket because while
they&amp;#39;re not selling in the same sense as a textbook publish, they are
selling or pitching their curriculum and platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s easy to see how we got here. There are so few people out there
that actually know both the CS content and how to teach it that there
was a void so EdTech and a few others stepped in. The truth is, most
of the big PD providers also don&amp;#39;t have both deep CS and deep CS
pedagogical knowledge. What they do have is influence. This isn&amp;#39;t to
say that they&amp;#39;re all bad. There are some providers whom I like very
much and I think are doing a great job but that&amp;#39;s not the point here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, we&amp;#39;re left with a system where the majority of CS teachers have
very little CS or CS teaching experience and the providers are pushing
very specific training tied closely with their product, course, or
curriculum. I know I&amp;#39;ll get some hate for this but it&amp;#39;s just where we
are right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This might change over time as preservice teaching programs start to
emerge but I fear that many of them will just continue the trend of
pushing canned curricula. I&amp;#39;ve already seen proposed and existing
programs that essentially have a teacher candidate go through a
version of APCS-A, APCS-P, a computers in society class and something else
similar and voila, CS teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s contrast all of this with math PD or at least the math PD that I
was subject to for most of my high school teaching career. Most
department meetings I attended always had a PD piece and that was
usually something interesting, or at least supposed to be interesting
presented by a colleague. It might be one of their practices or it
might be something they got from a conference or an outside PD. We&amp;#39;d
also have larger PD sessions a couple of times a year. Topics would be
things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to use the graphing calculator to explore functions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History and math&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Math in your student&amp;#39;s worlds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploring math competition problems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An introduction to some advanced or new math topic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motivating a lesson on something or other&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few of these were tied to a specific course and none were tied to a
specific implementation or curriculum. There might be a special
section on something like Geometers Sketchpad or a vendor might run a
session but those were in the minority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It was mostly about math and how to teach math and most offerings were
by teachers not content providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t know what math education PD is like now but what a word of
difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Will CS PD get better, and I do think locally, teacher  generated PD
is better? I don&amp;#39;t know. I&amp;#39;ve been told that the sessions I ran
pre-covid were worthwhile but I don&amp;#39;t see those happening again until
we can do in person events and in any event that&amp;#39;s small scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All this said and I haven&amp;#39;t touched on what led me to the article to
begin with - the point that PD is going much more virtual. Is this a
good thing? Sometimes but it&amp;#39;s also, in my opinion a confirmation on
the sad state of PD in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The idea behind PD is ongoing professional growth but the truth is,
teachers don&amp;#39;t really have time for PD during the school year so what
they do is mostly mandated. In my own experience and in talking to
many teachers in many subject areas the majority of PD forced upon
teachers is garbage. Even if it is good, too often it&amp;#39;s not relevant
to the teachers day to day and by the time it matters, if it ever
does, it&amp;#39;s long forgotten. Unfortunately, many teachers are required
to accumulate PD hours. In NY they&amp;#39;re called CTLE hours (Continuing
Teacher and Leader Education).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since teachers are being forced to accumulate these hours and they
don&amp;#39;t find them valuable they&amp;#39;re taking the path of least
resistance. That frequently means online offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
None of this is to say that online PD is bad or always bad. It can be
very effective for some things. Others really should be done in
person. I&amp;#39;m just saying that it&amp;#39;s not a surprise that we&amp;#39;re here and
that we have to look deeper to figure out how we got here and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Where do we go from here? I have no idea. I&amp;#39;ve long resigned myself to
try to just worry about my corner of the world. I&amp;#39;ll make the best
offerings I can be they in my pre/in service courses or in PD wether
they&amp;#39;re in person or online. I think that those that come will find
value so those are the ones I&amp;#39;ll worry about.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teaching CS  - all the educators to all the grades</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teaching-cs-in-all-the-grades/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27 Jun 2020 12:29:06 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teaching-cs-in-all-the-grades/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m kicking off a couple of exciting summer projects next week and
it&amp;#39;s been pointed out to me a couple of times that I&amp;#39;ll be working
with educators at every level to help them to deliver CS instruction
to students at every level. What an opportunity to be a part of and
learn from - working with every level of teacher for every level of
student. I&amp;#39;m part of the teaching teams but I think I&amp;#39;m also going to
learn a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, how is this happening? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One project I&amp;#39;m working on, entering its second year is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/ct-in-primary-grades/&#34;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; on
computational thinking in the early grades. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/yadavaman&#34;&gt;Aman Yadav&lt;/a&gt; and I, with the
support of the Robin Hood Foundation will be working with primary
grade teachers to develop experience that both teach computational
thinking and use CT to support the core subject areas. As we had last
time, we&amp;#39;ll have both working teachers and pre-service teachers - that
is, Hunter students close to earning their teaching degrees and
certifications. In the Fall, the pre-service teachers will student
teach under the supervision of the working teachers in our
program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Based on what we did last year I&amp;#39;m convinced that this years cohort
will get a lot out of the experience but I&amp;#39;m also convinced that the
workshop still faces the limitations of any professional development
style training - short duration, one shot, and no long term
support. PD can be valuable but I&amp;#39;m 100% convinced it&amp;#39;s not the answer
in terms of preparing CS teachers. At the end of the workshop, our
teachers will have learned something about CT, be more comfortable
with it, and have designed some lessons that they&amp;#39;ll deliver in the
Fall. It&amp;#39;s a start but it&amp;#39;s not the end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The game changer brings me to the other group of people
participating - four full time Hunter Faculty members. They all teach
in our School of Education. The aim is to see where we can add CT to
our pre-service classes. This moves the needle. If we do it right,
soon enough, every Hunter College primary grade teaching candidate
will be learning about Computational Thinking in their required Ed
classes. That&amp;#39;s how you do it - get it into pre-service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, that has me working with pre-service and in-service teachers as
well as full time research faculty. That&amp;#39;s a lot of levels of
educators but it&amp;#39;s not all the grades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That&amp;#39;s the other project we&amp;#39;re kicking off on Monday and one that I
plan to write a lot about over the next month and into next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We&amp;#39;re finally kicking off our Computer Science Teacher certification
program. We&amp;#39;ve got a cohort of a little over 20 teachers that will
take part in a month long intensive followed by more coursework in
the Fall. When they&amp;#39;re done, they&amp;#39;ll be among the first certified
computer science teachers in New York State. The cohort consists
mostly of High School teachers but we&amp;#39;ve got some middle school in
there as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This too is a game changer. We&amp;#39;re not giving a curriculum to follow or
scripts to copy but rather we&amp;#39;re teaching serious CS and how to teach
it. Of course it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt that the cohort is comprised of strong,
experienced teachers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So there it is - all the levels of teachers to all the levels of
students. I&amp;#39;m super excited to be part of both of these game changing
projects and can&amp;#39;t wait for Monday when we get to work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PD in NYC</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/pd-in-nyc/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I spent this past Saturday morning up at the Microsoft building in
Times Square. What was I doing there? &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/aankit?lang=en&#34;&gt;Aankit Patel&lt;/a&gt; invited me to check
out the professional development that he and his team organized for
the teachers involved in the assorted CSforAllNYC programs that his
office runs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Lots of great things going on. I was only able to stay for a couple of
hours but I spent some time in two rooms run by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tealsk12.org/&#34;&gt;TEALS&lt;/a&gt;, a room of &lt;a href=&#34;https://bjc.berkeley.edu/&#34;&gt;BJC&lt;/a&gt;
teachers, a group working with &lt;a href=&#34;https://p5js.org&#34;&gt;p5.js&lt;/a&gt;, one doing physical computing and
a bunch more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While there was good content all around I was really impressed with
the sense of community in many of the rooms. One of the hardest parts
of being a computer science teacher in K12 is that you&amp;#39;re frequently
the only CS teacher in your school. That can be an awfully lonely
existence. It&amp;#39;s hard to be the only teacher. No one to bounce lesson
ideas off of or to debrief with and if you leave your school they&amp;#39;re
left in the lurch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s simply amazing that all these NYC teachers have opportunities
like this past weekends PD and the communty it provides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, teachers who are not part of city programs like
SEP or TEALS don&amp;#39;t have these opportunities and at Hunter we&amp;#39;re trying
to do our piece to help solve that problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A few months ago I wrote about our plans to roll out once a month
professional development sessions for CTLE hours specifically aimed at
teachers who are ready for the next step. Those who are already
comfortable with the first courses and student experiences. I&amp;#39;m
describing the sessions as being for high school teachers teaching
APCS-A, similar or beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Were hosting our first session on December 13th. There will be a
couple of presentations or activities to get us started but the bulk
of the time will be about planning the rest of the sessions which will
run until the end of the school year and the hope is that we will
cover both content beyond the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, if you&amp;#39;re a public school CS teacher in NYC (and need CTLE hours)
and you&amp;#39;re ready for something more advanced than the usual PD
opportunities, why don&amp;#39;t you join us. Just sign up &lt;a href=&#34;https://goo.gl/forms/FJDyCx7qFec1yPjr1&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Space is
limited so if we fill, we&amp;#39;ll add you to the waitlist and we&amp;#39;ll work on
trying to find a bigger space to acomodate more teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Looking forward to getting this thing started!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
