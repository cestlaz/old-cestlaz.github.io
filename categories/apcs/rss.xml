      <title>Language choices for APCS</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/apcs-languages/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Over on Facebook the semi-regular &amp;#34;is APCS-A going to Python&amp;#34; once
again appeared. I&amp;#39;m not going to get into Python vs Java. Each language giveth and
each language taketh away but it got me thinking about the history of
language changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I titled this &amp;#34;Language choices for APCS&amp;#34; not APCS-A because back in
the day it was just APCS. At some point that split with APCS-A being similar
to what we have today and APCS-A being that plus a CS2 (data
structures) class. Finally after 2009, APCS-AB was dropped due to low
participation, I mean, my school represented 10% of the total test
takers - that&amp;#39;s nuts - 10% from one school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I took the exam during the first administration in 1984 and taught
APCS-AB from 1991 I think up until I left Stuy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Originally, APCS was in Pascal. Back then, the course guide said that
they intended for the exam to become language agnostic but that never
happened. Instead we went to C++ in 2000 and then to Java in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, I don&amp;#39;t have any inside information here. I&amp;#39;ve never been in on
any internal meetings so this is all just conjecture but I think it&amp;#39;s
interesting food for thought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back in 1984, schools were transitioning from either no
computers or Commodore PETS to Apple IIs. At Stuy, where I was a
student, the teacher had a single copy of a Pascal compiler on a
floppy disk and he made copies - one for each computer in the lab. Not
too much concern about piracy here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As we approached 2000 when APCS switched to C++ the knocks on Pascal
were: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a teaching language &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t have programs that were more than one file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t Object Oriented which gained a lot of steam over the
decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first item was also mentioned as a strength and item 2 really
wasn&amp;#39;t an issue in terms of what most people taught. In any event, the
College Board decided on a change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I started thinking about why C++ over Pascal? I know that C++ was the
hot industry language at the time and to be honest, I don&amp;#39;t remember
what other languages might have also been viable. I did think though
about one big factor in C++&amp;#39;s favor. By this time schools were moving
to IBM PCs and C++ had a really big hidden value - the existence of
Turbo C++. A C++ compiler and IDE that ran on the IBM PC and was
cheap. Prior to Turbo Pascal and Turbo C/C++ schools didn&amp;#39;t have the
ability to cheaply compile programs and certainly students who were
fortunate enough to have computers certainly couldn&amp;#39;t afford a
compiler. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have no idea if this factored into the decision but I think the
economics and the fact that compilers and development environments
were just not that available back then are an interesting bit of
history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about the next change? C++ to Java in 2004. By then I had moved
Stuy over to Linux but most schools were still on Windows. By this
time there were more affordable and even free compiler choices so I&amp;#39;m
guessing school economics didn&amp;#39;t have to enter the decision. What
probably did was the fact that APCS-A participants were stagnant and
APCS-AB were declining. One might conjecture that the complexity of
C++ had something to do with this. While Pascal also had memory
management C++ memory management is more complicated and less
forgiving. Also, since C++ is really a multimodal with &amp;#34;many ways to
do it&amp;#34; it was probably much harder for both students and teachers,
many of whom didn&amp;#39;t have a CS background. Java was the hot up and
comer, was not multi-modal but was indeed object oriented, and really
is a much simpler language. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, as I said, I have no idea what was discussed internally at the
college board but I think it&amp;#39;s interesting to think about the history.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>APCS Statistics</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/code-beyond-apcs/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday was, I think the fourth, To Code and Beyond conference hosted by
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/diane_levitt&#34;&gt;Diane Levitt&lt;/a&gt; at Cornell Technion. I might blog about a few of the
talks but for today let&amp;#39;s start with one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In spite of my anti College Board bias, I really enjoyed Barbara
Ericson&amp;#39;s talk on APCS statistics. Barbara&amp;#39;s been breaking down the
APCS numbers for years - how many took the exam(s), how many passed
them. By state, gender, etc. It&amp;#39;s all up on her &lt;a href=&#34;https://cs4all.home.blog/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While Barb had earlier provided the data online, in her talk, she 
did a great job drawing out and highlighting important and interesting
points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The TL;DR summary takeaways from the talk were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been some progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The numbers are sometimes so low that it wouldn&amp;#39;t take much to do
 better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That isn&amp;#39;t enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One point of comparison that came up was that while the number of APCS
exams is growing they still pale in comparison to the AP English and
AP Calc numbers. This makes sense though. Calc is generally percieved
as &amp;#34;the next math class&amp;#34; so students who finish precalc prior to
senior year will normally move on to calc. Even more so now than in
the past with more and more schools implementing a 4 year math
requirement. AP English is also a special case since it basically
replaces a regular English class so it might not even add anything to
a students day depending on the workload of AP vs their school&amp;#39;s
regular English class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Personally, I don&amp;#39;t care how many APCS exams are given but I&amp;#39;d love to
see a quality year of CS Education required in high schools across the
country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All of Barbara&amp;#39;s analysis is based on the public data that the College
Board releases. I got to thinking about all the factors we can&amp;#39;t
account for since the data either isn&amp;#39;t released by the College Board
or isn&amp;#39;t available at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, the data is on the state level. How many states are small
enough and homogeneous enough that we can treat them as a unit?
Certainly not NY. I&amp;#39;d love to see the AP data broken down by NYC vs
the rest of the state. It would also be great to be able to run stats
that looked at school factors. All this data could be made available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we had more data to play with we might learn or at least be able to
explore some interesting things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Take APCS-P. In 2019 7553 exams were given in New York State with 5239
passing. Now, it turns out that Brooklyn Tech decided to require
APCS-P of all of its students. Tech has a population of over 6000 so
figure about 1500 APCS-P tests or around 20% of the state. That&amp;#39;s from
JUST ONE SCHOOL!!!!!!  It&amp;#39;s also a test school. Just about every Stuy
student who takes APCS-A passes the exam so I&amp;#39;d guess the vast
majority of Tech APCS-P test takers do the same. Take out 1500 passing
exams and see what that does to the pass rate. Once again we have a
HUGE influence by one school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m don&amp;#39;t know if this means anything one way or another but it is
interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Going further, it would be great to know how schools are making
decisions as to what to offer and to whom. Is APCS-P required? Are the
students in the class(es) required to take the exam? Required classes
and requiring exams generally up the participation rates but lower pass
rates. How much elective room do students have? The questions go on
and on. I&amp;#39;m of the belief that two of the reasons for APCS-P&amp;#39;s rapid
growth and adoption are that it&amp;#39;s low hanging fruit. Schools want to
do some CS and this checks the box. Also, schools can move up in those
BS school ratings by having their kids take more AP exams and having a
relatively easy AP exam that can be passed by 9th and 10th graders is
an easy way to build your reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, the ratings game doesn&amp;#39;t always serve students. I once
heard a talk given by the principal of the highly lauded school
P-Tech. He proudly proclaimed that in his previous school BETA (he was
principal of the Bronx Engineering and Tech Academy prior to P-Tech)
he took kids that came in far behind in math and they all passed the
Honors APCS Calc exam. I later checked - BETA students took 228 AP exams
during the year in question and only 10 passed. The principal parlayed
these wonderful results into a much higher profile principalship of a
school so highly regarded it was mentioned by name at a State of the
Union address but I think it&amp;#39;s horribly cruel to set students up to
fail so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Getting back to Barbara&amp;#39;s talk - even with the limited granularity of
the data provided by the college board we can learn some interesting
things. Given the newness of APCS-P and in fact the newness of the CS
For All push it will be years before we can really figure anything out
but it&amp;#39;s all food for thought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks to Barbara for continuing on what she described as &amp;#34;an unpaid
job for life&amp;#34; as we&amp;#39;re all the beneficiaries of her work.&lt;/p&gt;
