      <title>When will I need to know this, Data Structures edition</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/when-need-ds/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
One of the things we&amp;#39;re frequently faced with as computer science
teachers is the questiosn of &amp;#34;when will I need to know this.&amp;#34; This
comes up when you teach an non-mainstream language like Racket or a
language kids sometimes see as inauthentic like Scratch. It also comes
up a lot when learning data structures and algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Do I really need to know all of these sorts when I&amp;#39;m just going to use
the built in sort routine? Do I really have to implement that hash
table or linked list when I&amp;#39;ll just use the standard library&amp;#39;s
implementation? You know, once I get past the technical interview for
fill-in-the-company I&amp;#39;ll never need it again so why are we wasting all
this time and energy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For the most part, these are valid questions to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the one hand it&amp;#39;s hard to  really say that a student &lt;strong&gt;needs&lt;/strong&gt; to
know all these things, I mean, we all know people with successful
careers in tech who know few or one of the these &amp;#34;questionable&amp;#34;
topics. On the other hand, it&amp;#39;s much easier to explain why one might
want to know or even benefit from knowing these &amp;#34;less relevant and
directly useful&amp;#34; topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Personally, I believe that you shouldn&amp;#39;t use a tool that you
couldn&amp;#39;t build yourself or rather, more realistically, you should
understand something of the topics underpinnings. For a hash table for
instance, one should understand that the internal storage structure
has to be sparse or be otherwise cleverly set up to avoid
collisions. Likewise if one understands the differences between an
array based structure and dynamically allocated one they can make
sensible decisions when they choose between a Java ArrayList and a
Java LinkedList.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The other biggie is that if they understand the data structures and
algorithms then they have a shot at creating derivative algorithms or
building solutions on top of data structures rather than just using
standard library implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course it&amp;#39;s much easier to convince students they might build or
use solutions that employ standard data structures and algorithms with
real world examples and fortunately we have them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In my data structures class, we&amp;#39;re currently covering Binary Search
Trees. At the end I talk a little about next steps - 2-3 trees,
red-black trees, B-trees etc. but to be honest students are probably
never going to write any of these. On the other hand we have a tree
implementation that students interact with on a daily basis and could
very well have to work with and manipulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The DOM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For those of you who don&amp;#39;t do web development, DOM stands for Document
Object Model and is the structure that your web browser uses to store
a web page. Web pages are written in HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language
which is a specific instance of XML - eXtensible Markup Language.
HTML is a hierarchical format and in fact is a textual way of
representing a tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For example, this HTML example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;example&#34;&gt;
  &amp;lt;div id=&amp;#34;anchor&amp;#34;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt; this is a heading &amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;item 1&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;item 2&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;item 3&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
has a &lt;strong&gt;div&lt;/strong&gt; as the root node with two children. the first child is the
&lt;strong&gt;h1&lt;/strong&gt; component (header 1) and the other is the ordered list -
&lt;strong&gt;ol&lt;/strong&gt;. the ordered list the has three children, those three &lt;strong&gt;li&lt;/strong&gt;
list item elements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;z_image_center&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/html-tree.png&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In fact, you can explore this tree through your web browser. You can
right click and explore the page or you can bring up the javascript
console and show that once you get an element with something like &lt;code&gt;d =
document.getElementById(&amp;#34;anchor&amp;#34;)&lt;/code&gt; you explore the tree with things
like &lt;code&gt;d.children&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;d.firstChild&lt;/code&gt; and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a pretty concrete example of a tree that CS students could
very well be working with and manipulating particularly given how many
front end opportunities exist out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It turns out there&amp;#39;s also a great example out there these days for the
linked list. Usually students can see the utility of the linked list
and it&amp;#39;s ability to insert and delete with a much lower cost than an
array but they also see the limitations that result from linear access
but where might they need to implement a linked type structure as
opposed to just using the built in LinkedList.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Nowadays we don&amp;#39;t have to look any further than &lt;strong&gt;blockchain&lt;/strong&gt;. A
blockchain literally is a linked list - each node has a reference to
it&amp;#39;s neighbor. It&amp;#39;s a perfect real world example. Of course once you
look at this example it&amp;#39;s easy to show others since linked constructs
are everywhere. The difficulty from the student point of view is they
frequently just think of them as &amp;#34;pointer&amp;#34; based structures where the
&amp;#34;pointer&amp;#34; is the language construct but it&amp;#39;s really just any reference
to the &amp;#34;next&amp;#34; item. That reference can be an index into an array for
instance and it would still build a linked list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think examples like these show students that they may indeed build
and or manipulate the data structures and algorithms they study as
budding computer scientists and in fact, they might not even realize
it. I was talking blockchain a while ago with a number of students and
it took quite a while before one said - &amp;#34;hey, this is really just a
linked list.&amp;#34; I think making that connection explicit and early can be
a big help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, do you have some real world examples like these that we can use to
help motivate our students to really learn some of these subjects that
at first glance are only useful to and through the technical
interview? If so, please share.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Heaps</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/heaps/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2020 13:53:43 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/heaps/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Continuing with the theme of alternate representations we just 
started &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)&#34;&gt;heaps&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap&#34;&gt;binary heaps&lt;/a&gt;. 
binary min and max heaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Heaps are one of my favorite topics in CS2. If you&amp;#39;re not familiar
with them, a binary min heap is a complete binary tree that enforces
the heap property. By being complete we mean that every level except
possibly the last one is full - that is 2 children. The last level is
as filled left to right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The heap property for a min heap is that the key value stored in any
node is less than the values in it&amp;#39;s children. Heaps are frequently
used as priority queues. There are plenty of great web sites and
videos that talk all about heaps - creating them, standard operations,
run time etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of the things I love about them though is that they tie together
arrays and trees. Up until now, we&amp;#39;ve been using pointers to represent
trees. Our binary trees are represented by a class with a pointer to a
root node. Each node has pointers to left and right
children. Technically you could represent a heap in this way but with
a heap you have to be able to not only navigate easily from parent to
child but also from child to parent. This would make things a bit
unwieldy with additional parent pointers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Instead consider the following tree:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/heap/heap1.png&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve numbered each of the nodes with the root - node 0 holding a key
value of 10. We can easily store this tree in an array:#heaps.org#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/heap/heap1-array.png&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We have an easy relationship between parent and child. Given any node &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;,
its children are located at &lt;code&gt;2n+1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;2n+2&lt;/code&gt;. Likewise we can use
integer division  &lt;code&gt;(n-1)/2&lt;/code&gt; to find a node&amp;#39;s parent. Easy peasy. This
is both easy and efficient and of course we can also go from an array
to a tree and in fact, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort&#34;&gt;heapsort&lt;/a&gt; algorithm takes an arrray and
rearranges the elements into a heap and then uses heap operations to
sort the array all in place and in O(nlgn) time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here we have another cool representation. We can of course represent a
tree by explicitly creating classes for nodes with all the required
pointers but here we are implicitly creating a tree by using a mapping
to relate nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We could of course do this for any binary tree:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/heap/heap2.png&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/heap/heap2-array.png&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; Nodes 11 and 12 in the tree above should be 13 and 14. I messed up the
graphviz dot source for the diagram and am too lazy to
correct. Likewise there should be two extre cells in the array and the
32 and 50 should be in cells 13 and 14 respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is where the completeness comes in. The fact that a heap is
complete and the last level is filled in left to right means that
there aren&amp;#39;t any unused cells in the array. If we just had any old
binary tree like the one above, we&amp;#39;re going to waste space. It could
still at times be a useful representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I like talking to my students about these types of data structures and
representations. Without considering cases like this you can get
programmers who adhere to the saying that &amp;#34;If your only tool is a
hammer then every problem looks like a nail.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alternate Representations</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/alternate-representations/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Apr 2020 12:54:05 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/alternate-representations/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
There was a comment on my last post about &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/arbitrary-trees/&#34;&gt;arbitary trees&lt;/a&gt; on Reddit
talking about how this type of data structure was a hold over from the
old days when computer resources were more limited. Nowadays having a
list of children makes more sense. The comment was of course correct
but I still think it&amp;#39;s worth teaching representations like the one I
spoke of in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/arbitrary-trees/&#34;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Looking at interesting and different ways of representing data and
modeling solutions is one of the things that separates programmers or
coders from computer scientists and software engineers. I&amp;#39;m not
talking about commonly accepted definitions or advanced classwork or
theory and mathy stuff. I&amp;#39;m talking about how you approach a problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To me, the coder or programmer is someone who has learned rudimentary
coding prowess but learned via rote example. This is typical of a code
school graduate or many self taught programmers. This is not to say
that people who learned this way are not computer scientists at heart
nor that they don&amp;#39;t have the ability to think deeply about problems
but rather that their training was superficial - usually to get them
to market quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I know many people who started on their own following a book or mooc
or code school and grew beyond those basics but we&amp;#39;ve also seen many
&amp;#34;coders&amp;#34; who brute force using the same techniques regardless of
appropriateness. I can&amp;#39;t tell you how many times I&amp;#39;ve seen an SQL
database used inappropriately as a flat file store or forcing
relationships when not optimal in something like MongoDB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We don&amp;#39;t want our students to merely parrot the solution that we went
over in class. We want them to consider the problem at hand and all
the tools in their tool belt and come up with what makes sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I like the arbitrary tree example as it uses the same internal
structure as a binary tree does: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-java&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For a binary search tree pointer1 is left and pointer 2 is right. For
an arbitrary tree they represent first child and next sibling. The
same structure can also be used for a doubly linked list with previous
and next or a skip list. It&amp;#39;s all about creatively using the tools at
hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are a number of lessons during which we can stretch our students
thinking in terms of data representations in our early classes. One is
when we can augment a data structure to avoid special cases. I wrote
about this when solving a maze or the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-02-26-change-the-data/&#34;&gt;knight&amp;#39;s tour&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Those problems are also great place to talk about implicit data
structures. When we do our maze solver we talk about state space
search. The idea that there&amp;#39;s this huge graph where each node is the
a potential state of the maze and the edges represent how we can move
from state to state:#alternate-representations.org#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/mazestates.png&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The above graph can be considered an implicit data structure - it
never actually exists as a whole in our program. Our solver usually
uses a two dimensional array to represent a specific state of our
maze - that is, one node of the graph. We change the array as we make
and return from recursive calls. That recursion creates and destroys
nodes in our graph. At any point in time, each layer of stack in the
recursion holds one node in our graph with the top of the stack being
our current state but we never actually create or internally represent
the full graph. It&amp;#39;s an ephemeral implicit data structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, one very early opportunity to discuss these types of ideas
come when you use an array as a set of buckets where the index is the
value and the entry is the count. It&amp;#39;s pretty simple but a very
different way of using an array or list when all you&amp;#39;ve seen is using
it to store actual items. I like doing this in the context of a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-03-23-who_won_the_election-quadratic_to_linear_time/&#34;&gt;frequency&lt;/a&gt; lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any event, it&amp;#39;s sometimes worthwhile to look at solutions that may
no longer be optimal - they can be great triggers of both student
thought and discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Arbitrary Trees</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/arbitrary-trees/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2020 18:45:50 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/arbitrary-trees/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s been 10 days from my last post. Not really a big break for me
historically but certainly a big one given how much I&amp;#39;ve been posting
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Been under the weather for the past couple of weeks dealing with
COVID-19. Haven&amp;#39;t had super bad symptoms and as symptoms have been
getting fewer and less severe I&amp;#39;m hoping I&amp;#39;m close to a full recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any event, I&amp;#39;m feeling good enough for a quick post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In my data structures class we&amp;#39;ve been working on binary trees. Most
of the unit is focused on &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree&#34;&gt;Binary Search Trees&lt;/a&gt;. They used to be a big
part of the B part of the old APCS-AB and are still a mainstay of
college CS2 classes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As usual, we covered all the basics. Creation, insertion, search,
traversal, and deletion. We discovered the run times and how a tree
structure can yield lgn behavior but can also degenerate to linear. We
also give a preview of more advanced data structures like red/back and
2-3 trees that address these issues (not to mention things like BTrees
and Splay trees).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One side topic I always like talking about during this unit though are
arbitrary trees. That is, trees where each node can have an arbitrary
number of children. Students usually start by creating nodes with an
array of children and then sometimes a linked list of children but I
like discussing something simpler. A tree where in each node you hold
two pointers - a pointer to the first child and a pointer to the next
sibling. I like this because internally it&amp;#39;s the same as a binary
search tree where you also have two pointers in each node a left and a
right. Same &amp;#34;physical&amp;#34; representation but two very different
variations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;figure class=&amp;#34;z_image_center&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;#34;/img/arbtree.png&amp;#34;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The image on the left is the actual arbitrary tree and the one on the
right shows the internal representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In terms of applications, the file system is a
great example of an arbitrary tree. Another one that I like even more
is the DOM representation of a web page. That&amp;#39;s nice because there are
Javascript functions to get the next sibling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I put a short video together for my class. Here it is in case anyone
is interested. It&amp;#39;s code agnostic so would be suitable for an APCS-A
class that also covers data structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
