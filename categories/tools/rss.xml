      <title>Copilot and similar types of AI in learning CS</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/ai-in-learning-cs/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2023 14:50:07 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/ai-in-learning-cs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
So it seems like Copilot and similar will be beneficial to programmers
but the question remains as to how beneficial. Will it be incremental
change or will it be a game changer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today we&amp;#39;ll look at how it will affect teaching and learning CS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It seems pretty clear that one group of learners will benefit from
things like copilot - people who are already strong programmers who
are learning something new. Like autocomplete on steroids it will free
those programmers of having to look everything up all the time. I
guess a second group that will benefit will be autodidacts but they&amp;#39;ll
thrive no matter what and when we&amp;#39;re talking about opportunity and
equity we&amp;#39;ve got to focus on everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For everyone else, particularly those learning in classes using
copilot will have certain benefits but the real question isn&amp;#39;t &amp;#34;is
there an advantage&amp;#34; but rather a costs benefits analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since copilot can be thought of as autocomplete on steroids we can
compare the discord that goes on when discussing IDEs with
autocomplete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some teachers think autocomplete is great and don&amp;#39;t see any downside
to students using editors that support it. Others feel that it&amp;#39;s
important for students to type everything out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the one hand, you can have autocomplete for things like
&lt;strong&gt;system.out.writeln&lt;/strong&gt; - type &lt;strong&gt;writeln&lt;/strong&gt; and hit tab and you&amp;#39;re done. One
could argue that if you&amp;#39;re ever in an environment without autocomplete
you&amp;#39;d be screwed but if you think about it, there&amp;#39;s no deeper
understanding if you type &lt;strong&gt;system.out.writeln&lt;/strong&gt; vs &lt;strong&gt;writeln&lt;/strong&gt;
particularly for beginners where the system.out is boilerplate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand typing &lt;strong&gt;for&lt;/strong&gt; and having that complete to a for loop
is different than actually typing out the complete loop. One could
argue that typing for and then tab is just a higher level of
abstraction but I&amp;#39;d argue that it&amp;#39;s important to understand what&amp;#39;s
going on with the loop first. This is where I&amp;#39;m not sure if the
autocompletion is the right way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ideally, I&amp;#39;d love to see students &amp;#34;level up&amp;#34; - after typing out for
loops for a bit they can unlock the for loop autocomplete feature -
hey - now that&amp;#39;s an idea for a student ide!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I know that some people also feel that hand writing things is an aide
to learning. If that&amp;#39;s so, is typing as well? Is writing a for loop by
hand then then typing better? Is typing it all out better than just
drag and dropping a block? I don&amp;#39;t know the answer to any of these but
I think they&amp;#39;re interesting questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The question, or at least one of the questions about using copilot in
teaching and learning is the same but copilot takes it to the next
level. Instead of typing &lt;strong&gt;for&lt;/strong&gt; tab and getting a for loop you can type
&lt;strong&gt;// sum the values of an integer array ar&lt;/strong&gt; - you can use it to
complete programming &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/programming-idioms/&#34;&gt;idioms&lt;/a&gt; or even complete functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Bigger time concepts but the same basic ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is another question that I think is going to get lost in the
shuffle though. Even if we decide that using copilot like technologies
is an absolute win, will there be unintended consequences. Will other
things be lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This has happen time and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In CS, when APCS-A/B went from C++ to Java we lost memory
management. This was good in certain ways but memory management is an
important concept for computer science students to understand. Take it
out of CS1 and CS2 and you have to put it back somewhere else. From
what the people doing the hiring in tech in the years following 5
years after the switch, it wasn&amp;#39;t always put back or put back
effectively. This isn&amp;#39;t a surprise since every college does things
their own way and if a student places out of one or more courses with
AP credit, well, they might miss something critical or be less well
prepared for it when it does appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The other big example I always use is from math. Calculators. No, I&amp;#39;m
not going to say that having students work out hard arithmetic by hand
was a good and important thing. I&amp;#39;m talking about interpolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Prior to calculators, when our students learned about logs or trig
functions they had log and trig tables. The tables only had so many
entries so students had to find values between the entries and they
invariable did have to, they learned and used linear interpolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you think about it, that might have been the most useful real life
math skill taught in high school math at the time. Certainly it was up
there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hello calculators, goodbye trig and log tables. Goodbye learning
interpolation. That&amp;#39;s a skill that&amp;#39;s been lost to students for now
almost a quarter of a century. Sure, students can and have been
functioning with knowing interpolation but when you look at the math
that has and hasn&amp;#39;t been taught I&amp;#39;m fairly confident in saying that
when we stopped teaching interpolation something was lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That&amp;#39;s my fear of copilot type technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When we teach mergesort we&amp;#39;re not just teaching mergesort. We&amp;#39;re
teaching the concept of divide and conquer algorithms. We&amp;#39;re
discussing run time. We&amp;#39;re looking at sorting in place or not. We also
have a platform to discuss solving problems that make use of different
but similar algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When we solve a dynamic programming problem we&amp;#39;re not solving a
specific problem but we&amp;#39;re teaching a general method of problem
solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At a smaller scale level, when beginners program they make errors. Now
error messages aren&amp;#39;t particularly helpful but learning how to read
them and fix ones errors is yet another manner of problem solving
we&amp;#39;re teaching. Some may argue that error messages will get better in
the future. Well, I&amp;#39;ve been programming for decades and while they&amp;#39;re
a little better than from way back, they&amp;#39;ve got a way to go. Besides
the problem sometimes isnot so much that the error is bad but that
students don&amp;#39;t take the time to read through the (admittedly overly
complex) wall of text. Solving unexpected errors, reading
documentation, searching for solutions. These are all things we&amp;#39;re
teaching beyond just the coding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Copilot might make for faster coding but how much of our ability to
teach that more important problem solving will be lost?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course the answer might be none or it might be that the benefits
might outweigh the costs but educators should pay close attention not
to the superficial but very cool way that copilot replaces a short
prompt with a long coded solution but rather to what we&amp;#39;re really
trying to teach our kids beyond grunt coding and how will copilot
affect that.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AI as a programmers aide</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/ai-in-programming/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2023 11:33:22 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/ai-in-programming/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
ChatGPT in education has been all the rage but there&amp;#39;s another twist
on AI that was getting some buzz even earlier - AI based code
completions. GitHub&amp;#39;s Copilot has gotten the most air time but there
are others out there as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When you code with Copilot, you type in a function name and maybe a
comment above it and the AI system will fill in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A canonical example seems to be Mergesort. Type in mergesort, hit the
magic key, and the function appears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was asked by a friend how this might affect teaching programming and
I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about it for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was going to share my thoughts today but realized that first, we
have to talk about products like Copilot as a programmers aid and then
we can talk about it as a learning tool. Today, we&amp;#39;ll cover the former
and next post the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, I&amp;#39;m not a professional programmer - at least I haven&amp;#39;t been one since
before I started teaching. I&amp;#39;ve done personal projects, some one off
contracts and a few applications for work but I haven&amp;#39;t written one of
those since I wrote a resume/interview managing system when Hunter won
the CUNY2X grant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even so, I think I&amp;#39;ve got a few thoughts worth sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s first consider what these tools can do right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I started by playing with the mergesort exampe. I asked for it and the
AI&amp;#39;s obliged. This could be seen as a time saver but is it? It turned
out every time I tried I got a good basic mergesort but the merge part
was always another function call - still had to write or generate
that so it&amp;#39;s not just specify and move on. It&amp;#39;s specify, verify, and
then either tweak or move on. It also wasn&amp;#39;t optimized in any way. You
can decide for yourself if that&amp;#39;s good or bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A pro can tell me if using Copilot in this sense is a
time saver but I&amp;#39;m not so sure. Even if it is, wouldn&amp;#39;t most
programmers just use the built in sort function? It seems like in this
sense, tools like Copilot are like using a library but with inline
expansion and without verification. A mixed bag at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even if the AI always got it right and was clear I wonder how much
time would really be saved. Most of my time programming is spent
thinking and editing and Copilot is about the generating. I don&amp;#39;t
doubt that it can be useful but in it&amp;#39;s current state, maybe not so
much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The big benefit using it this way is if you ask it to write something
that you don&amp;#39;t know how to write but is that really a good idea given
that the code still has to be verified?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The other sense I&amp;#39;ve seen these tools used in is more like how Gmail
autocompletes sentences in your email. Again, very cool but I&amp;#39;m not
sure how useful. For the Gmail stuff, I always see the completions but
almost always just continue typing. I guess it&amp;#39;s similar to how a fast
typist frequently won&amp;#39;t fix errors, they&amp;#39;ll retype them. For example,
if you accidentally type Froderick instead of Frederick, a fast typist
probably wouldn&amp;#39;t fix the o. They&amp;#39;d probably delete the word backwards
and retype it. More keystrokes but they stay in the flow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, right now these tools seem cool but maybe not all that useful. I
could see benefit today by having them generate language idioms like
&amp;#34;sum a list&amp;#34; - things that templates and current autocomplete can&amp;#39;t
quite do but can be verified on the fly in no time but that&amp;#39;s about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the future, however things could change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The idea that at some point one could generate code from a description
is pretty appealing. Of course, that brings a challenge that many
beginner programmers have to deal with - specification. I tell my
students all the time &amp;#34;Computers are lousy at doing what you want them
to do but great at doing what you tell them to do.&amp;#34; Writing a program
for these not-yet-existing AIs will be all about writing
specifications and the specification will turn into our program. This
really isn&amp;#39;t too different than what goes on today. A for loop is a
higher level specification for some gotos and conditionals. A foreach,
a higher level specification of a for and when you add in Lisp like
higher level functions like map and filter that&amp;#39;s higher level
still. An AI like a future generation of Copilot can be just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My verdict? Are they cool? Yes. An aid to productivity? I&amp;#39;m not
sure. Will they get there? Probably but I don&amp;#39;t know when.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next time, we&amp;#39;ll talk about how these tools can change the landscape
of teaching and learning programming.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Zulip - maybe the answer for class communication</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/zulip/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2020 14:01:23 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/zulip/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s always been a challenge to get students to buy in to an out of
class communication tool. Over the years I&amp;#39;ve tried many including
mailing lists, Piazza, Discourse, Vanilla and other discussion forums,
Slack and probably a few other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I guess it&amp;#39;s not surprising that it&amp;#39;s a hard sell - prior to the
internet once school was out kids there as no teacher student
interaction until the next school day and kids would only interact
with their direct friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Still, we have technology and even without great buy in, if nothing
else there&amp;#39;s an advantage to having an electronic means of
distributing things to students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ultimately I fell back on a plain old mailing list. Discussion/forum
platforms didn&amp;#39;t work for me because it was yet another location that
you had to remember to check. Slack didn&amp;#39;t work because at its core
it&amp;#39;s for live chat and while workers are at their desks all day and
can have a chat open, that doesn&amp;#39;t work with students and catching up
on a complex Slack with threads after the fact is, well, just no. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With us going remote in Coronatime needs changed. Slack looked like it
might be more viable. It still had the problem of limited threads but
in addition to students being more &amp;#34;always on,&amp;#34; for better or worse,
live remote teaching benefits form a chat. Why Slack over the built in
Zoom chat? Well, one thing is that the Zoom chat disappears after the
session whereas Slack lives on and can form the base for ongoing
discussion. Second, dedicated chat platforms like Slack are more
robust and featureful.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Over the summer and into this semester, Slack seems to be working very
well for my teacher certification candidates but I ended up using
something else - &lt;a href=&#34;https://zulip.com&#34;&gt;Zulip&lt;/a&gt; for my undergraduate classes and plan to move
my teachers over to it for the next cohort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why the change? Both Zulip and Slack have free tiers but Zulip can
also be self hosted and is open source. Slack is slicker when it comes
to integrations but Zulip is the clear winner for combined sync and
async conversations due to its threading model combined with flexible
alerts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I put together this short video showing  the basics - check it out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xWa56KdgYZM&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can use Zulip free on their site with similar limits as for
Slack&amp;#39;s free tier or you can self host. I&amp;#39;m running our Zulip
instances on a Digital Ocean droplet. DO has a &amp;#34;one click&amp;#34; Zulip setup
that was fairly straightforward. You might want to check that out if
you&amp;#39;re comfortable as a Linux admin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So far, I&amp;#39;m liking Zulip very much and thing I&amp;#39;ll be using it as my
primary in and out of class communication tool. I&amp;#39;d like a better
selection of emoji and wish it was easier to both use integrations and
write bots but the thread based interface is really great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I know Slack&amp;#39;s the big name and I do like Slack as well but if you&amp;#39;re
a teacher and looking for an in and out of class chat/communication
platform check Zulip out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Github and Student Feedback</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/github-student-feedback/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Jul 2020 16:12:47 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/github-student-feedback/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Beyond the CS specifics We&amp;#39;ve been primarily using three tools in our
summer certification program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zoom for video conferencing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slack for text based communicaiton&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitHub for just about everything else&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use GitHub as a CMS - a place to share code and assignments as well
as collect them. We&amp;#39;re also playing with GitHub discussions although
that&amp;#39;s fallen somewhat to the wayside with Slack being preferred. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of the choices I&amp;#39;m digging more than ever is &lt;a href=&#34;https://classroom.github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub Classroom&lt;/a&gt; for
assignments. Recently GitHub added a feedback feature powered through
what known as Pull Requests. You just have to check the &amp;#34;feedback&amp;#34;
button when you create an assignment. I also set my notifications so I
receive an email alert whenever a students submits anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Whenever a student updates an assignment or in Git parlance commits
and pushes up a change, I get an email alert. The email includes: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The repo where the change was made &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A brief message describing the most recent change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A link the the students GitHub account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A link to the actual change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clicking on the change and I get to a screen like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/githubdiff.png&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A summary of exactly what changed. I see lines that were deleted,
lines that were added and lines that were modified. At the top I see
the one line brief description which the student put in when making
the commit. I can also easily navigate through their assignment both
to see other parts of it as well as earlier versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you scroll down the page there&amp;#39;s a place you can leave a comment
which will go to the student. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This all makes for a very quick and easy feedback mechanism. You can
also go to the &amp;#34;pull request&amp;#34; section of the repo (link at the top of
the repo page) where you can find all the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All in all this provides a very quick and painless way of seeing what
students are up to and a quick way to provide some feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The only catch is that this only works when the students actively push
changes up to GitHub. While this group of teachers have been great
that&amp;#39;s sometimes a challenge with high school or college
students. Working on strategies to get this type of buy in from my
first years in the Fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, GitHub Classroom&amp;#39;s feedback mechanism? A big win and more great
work from the GitHub education team.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pro Version Or Education Version</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/pro-version-or-ed-version/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 May 2020 19:00:13 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/pro-version-or-ed-version/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I woke up to this tweet by Mark Guzdial today:#pro-version-or
ed-version.org#&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;An indication
that CS Ed in US high schools is about vocational training: 2 (of 5)
recommended sessions at the &lt;a
href=&#34;https://twitter.com/csteachersorg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@csteachersorg&lt;/a&gt;
conference are on Github and Agile. Is &lt;a
href=&#34;https://twitter.com/CSforALL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@CSforAll&lt;/a&gt;
a Silicon Valley jobs program? &lt;a
href=&#34;https://t.co/n8ugnmTU84&#34;&gt;https://t.co/n8ugnmTU84&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash;
Mark Guzdial (@guzdial) &lt;a
href=&#34;https://twitter.com/guzdial/status/1265986599952822272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;May
28, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async
src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34;
charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This led to a lively discussion throughout the day with lots of likes
and lots of comments. Two themes emerged. One wondered if the CSTA
conference should be highlighting these talks about professional
sensibilities and the other questioned the use of tools designed for
industry vs those designed for schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s look at the former first. For full disclosure JonAlf and I are
co-presenters of the GitHub session that was highlighted. Truth be
told I had no idea it was highlighted until I read Mark&amp;#39;s tweet
:-). CSTA is a conference for teachers, K12 teachers. Teachers go
to learn new practices. Sure there are sessions about advocacy and
the like but
it&amp;#39;s really more like a multi day professional development session on
steroids. That&amp;#39;s one of the things that makes it so wonderful. If a
session gives teachers something of value it&amp;#39;s worth presenting. It
can be what they teach, how they teach, or something ancillary to
teaching even things as mundane as gradebook management. If it helps
make a CS teacher better, it&amp;#39;s appropriate to include. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I can&amp;#39;t say why any particular session was chosen for highlight
but it really isn&amp;#39;t a big deal. There are always sessions on specific lesson
ideas, cross curricular stuff, ethics, standards, equity, CS4All,
APCS, and lots lots more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, what I&amp;#39;d like to see would be a banner on the conference page
where every time you go there it displays a random assortment of
sessions that are being offered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about the second point - professional tools or educational ones. First
let&amp;#39;s lump things together, git is a tool, so is GitHub. Same for
agile - it&amp;#39;s a tools as are programming languages. Now a great
craftsman is a great craftsman but their job is a whole lot easier
with a full chest of quality tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If a professional tool makes a teacher better it&amp;#39;s worth learning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s look at agile. I&amp;#39;ve never used terms like scrum or sprint in my
class but pair programming comes out of agile and that&amp;#39;s become a
mainstay of CS classes. Same thing for the short development cycle and
all the testing. These are agile concepts that we take for granted as
education tools. Are we going to use everything about agile in every
CS class? No. Does it belong in CS when CS is embedded in other
subject areas? Who knows but if a teacher gets exposed to it at CSTA
then they can make an informed decision and use it when and as
appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about git/GitHub? I wouldn&amp;#39;t teach using it when CS is embedded
but I might in a HS programming course and I certainly would in APCS-A
or beyond. I&amp;#39;ve found that there are many positives of using them and
I&amp;#39;ve written about it before on this blog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The truth is that both git and agile provide ways of increasing
student communication and collaboration and these are good things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even if I decided that my classes shouldn&amp;#39;t use git, I&amp;#39;d still use it
for my web presence and to distribute materials and that too makes it
worth learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Just because a tool came from industry it&amp;#39;s not
necessarily bad and if it came fro education it&amp;#39;s not necessarily
good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thonny is a beginner Python IDE. It was designed specifically to be a
learner environment. It&amp;#39;s great for that. Eclipse is a professional
IDE and I hate it for education. Other people disagree with me on both
counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand I&amp;#39;ve seen tools written by people in education that
are god awful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then you also have well designed education tools but they fill a
narrow niche - they&amp;#39;re so specialize that a teacher and student can
only use them in a specific case. A teacher then needs to find
multiple tools for their multiple classes and students need to learn
even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s assume we have a bunch of these educational tools and their all
pretty well designed and help students get to whatever it is they&amp;#39;re
supposed to learn. Taken individually each tool seems great but taken
as a whole? Where&amp;#39;s the line? Is it better to have the teacher learn
and support a handful of these and students learn even more or should
they spend more time/efforn to learn one or two tools where the tool
will beuseful beyond the narrow scope of the specialized one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The answer is of course, it depends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was part of a workshop this past summer and this came up. We were
looking at a pretty sweet specialized tool that worked really well for
one niche area. We also looked at Google Sheets which were less
intuitive but more versatile and universal. Which to use? We never
came up with a compelling answer either way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s nothing inherently bad about industry tools and there&amp;#39;s
nothing inherently good about educational ones. It&amp;#39;s true that
industry tools are designed for industry but education tools are by
and large not designed by teachers. They might be designed by people
who teach as part of their job or who have taught but that&amp;#39;s not the
same thing. Sometimes they hit but sometimes they miss their mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In math class we would typically draw arcs and circles on the board
with a giant chalk compass. It was specifically designed for
education. You know what works better? A shoelace.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Zoom alternatives that aren&#39;t from MicroGoogle</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/bigbluebutton/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2020 16:33:17 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/bigbluebutton/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
As we scrambled to move online in March we used what we knew, what we
heard of and what we were allowed. This usually meant Zoom, Google
Meet, or Microsoft Teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I settled on Zoom. It worked and worked pretty well. There were a few
things I felt they could improve on but given that Zoom wasn&amp;#39;t
designed as a teaching tool I&amp;#39;ve been pretty happy with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now that the emergency rush has passed we have time to see if there
are some better alternatives. First up is &lt;a href=&#34;https://bigbluebutton.org/&#34;&gt;BigBlueButton&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;ll write up
another cool platform that&amp;#39;s based on BigBlueButton in some future
post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To start, BBB is open source. That&amp;#39;s a big plus in my book. This means
we can self host it. Now, this can be a problem if installation and
maintenance is a pain but so far, it&amp;#39;s been carefree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next, it has some nice features. It supports pretty much everything
that Zoom supports including: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;join passwords&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;waiting room&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brady Bunch view &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;chat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reactions (raise hand etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a shared whiteboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;screen sharing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;breakout rooms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;optional session recording. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;polling &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and adds a few:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a shared note space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shared whiteboard is really a presentation that you can upload&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A simple html5 client &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BBB is also based on &amp;#34;classrooms&amp;#34; rather than meetings which as
a teacher seems cleaner and makes more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you want to try it out and I highly recommend you do, you can do so
on their web site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hosting is also pretty easy. I was originally turned off by the
strangely specific requirement of Ubuntu 16.04 but since Digital
Ocean - my preferred cloud provider lets me directly install that or
many other versions it wasn&amp;#39;t a problem. You&amp;#39;ll also need a box with
4GB memory and 4 cores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can follow the install instructions on the BBB home page but it
was easier to follow &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install&#34;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; instructions. Here&amp;#39;s exactly what I did
(culled from the longer explanations on the bbb-install site I just
linked):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create the DO droplet or install an Ubuntu 16.04 mathine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log in and run &lt;code&gt;apt-get update&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;apt-get dist-upgrade&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;apt-get upgrade&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up DNS for the box so you can get to it by name. To do this I
went to Google domains and added an entry for
bigbluebutton.huntercs.org.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I ran (all one line):&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;wget -qO- https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/bbb-install.sh | bash -s -- -v xenial-22 -s bbbtest.huntercs.org -e zamansky@gmail.com -g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;gt;}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    This downloads and installs BBB and also uses &lt;strong&gt;certbot&lt;/strong&gt; to set up
    ssl for secure connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After this was done, I created an admin account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;cd greenlight/
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;docker exec greenlight-v2 bundle exec rake admin:create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;gt;}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At this point I was up and running so I went to the host and logged in
using the admin credentials that the above command gave me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next, log in, go to the user profile and change the admin account&amp;#39;s
login and password. I also went to the org site settings and changed
registration so that people had to be invited - this only affects who
can create classrooms. Anyone can join as long as the teacher lets the
in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a last step you should remove the demos: &lt;code&gt;apt-get purge
bbb-demo&lt;/code&gt;. The home page and install web site has more info on those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You&amp;#39;re now ready to go. Make classrooms, invite your students and
you&amp;#39;re off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Check it out. so far, I&amp;#39;m liking it better than the non free non open
source alternatives offered by Zoom, Microsoft, and Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next, well look at another platform  that&amp;#39;s based on BBB that adds
some very cool features for CS Teachers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Github Org Explorer - now with oauth</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/github-org-explorer-oauth/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2020 12:53:59 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/github-org-explorer-oauth/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
A while ago I wrote about a small side project - &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/github-org-explorer/&#34;&gt;GitHub Org Explorer&lt;/a&gt; -
a small tool to make it easier to manager GitHub repositories based on
organization. I&amp;#39;m using it as a replacement for the GitHub provided
Classroom Assistant. I find it more flexible in terms of exporting
assignments to my own machine and it allows me to delete repos en
masse which is critical after the semester is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Shortly after I released it I found that GitHub was going to sunset
the basic authentication I was using so I had to convert the
application to support oauth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, here it is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Along the way I had a few headaches. I wrote about them &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/my-code-works/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Mostly
versioning issues surrounding the node ecosystem. I still haven&amp;#39;t
figured it all out but I think I&amp;#39;ve gotten everything working
alright. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you want to check it out, you can grab it off GitHub. Here&amp;#39;s the
repo: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/github-org-explorer&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/github-org-explorer&#34;&gt;https://github.com/zamansky/github-org-explorer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s the short runthrough video I made. Logging in looks different
but everything operates the same way:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m a big fan of &lt;a href=&#34;https://classroom.github.com&#34;&gt;GitHub Classroom&lt;/a&gt; and use it for all of my class
assignments. It&amp;#39;s great for organizing, distributing, and collecting
assignments and gets the kids used to using real world tools at the
same time. I&amp;#39;ve written a bunch of posts on how I use it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/github-classroom/&#34;&gt;How I use GitHub Classroom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/communicating-with_students/&#34;&gt;Communicating with Students - meybe GitHub to the rescue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/sigcse-2017-github-4/&#34;&gt;GitHub as a tool for education&lt;/a&gt; (part of a 4 part series)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as a couple of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since I like doing things on the command line I&amp;#39;ve been using GitHub&amp;#39;s
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/education/classroom-assistant&#34;&gt;Classroom Assistant&lt;/a&gt; to download repos. It&amp;#39;s a nice tool - I can
download any or all repos for any given assignment at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Still, this leaves me wanting in three areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First is roster integration. They have some rudimentary work done on
this but it&amp;#39;s not quite there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Second is being able to download repos based on other criteria. For
example, downloading all of the assignments from a single student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Third is deleting repos. GitHub Classroom uses GitHub organizations to
store submissions. You get one per student (or group) per
assignment. This gets really big really fast and it pollutes your
GitHub account with lots of repos that, quite frankly, I don&amp;#39;t want
once the semesters done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If only there was a way to address this….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Well, given that the good people at GitHub publish their &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.github.com/&#34;&gt;APIs&lt;/a&gt; one can
write their own applications to use with or integrate with GitHub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I wrote a small app, still experimental but functional. It&amp;#39;s an
&lt;a href=&#34;https://electronjs.org&#34;&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt; app (another thanks to GitHub) written in Clojurescript. I
might write about creating it later but for now, I just wanted to
share the app in case it&amp;#39;s useful to anybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Once you log in you can go to any of your GitHub organizations. Since
GitHub Classrooms are based on organizations this will present you
with all the repos for a given one. Then you can filter via regular
expressions and then either export or delete them. For me it&amp;#39;s the
missing piece. I plan to add roster support some time in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If anyone&amp;#39;s interested, here&amp;#39;s the GitHub repo: &lt;a href=&#34; https://github.com/zamansky/github-org-explorer&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/github-org-explorer&#34;&gt;https://github.com/zamansky/github-org-explorer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And a short video walkthrough of how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34;

      <title>Evaluating Java IDES for teaching teachers.</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/java-ides/</link>

      <description>
&lt;p&gt;
Since Hunter uses C++ as it&amp;#39;s core language, I haven&amp;#39;t used Java much
in the past three years. That&amp;#39;s going to change pretty soon. Once we
start offering our CS teacher Certificate and Masters programs I&amp;#39;ll
once again start teaching with Java as that&amp;#39;s one of the langauges
that we want to prepare our teachers with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That means deciding on a set of tools and so I&amp;#39;ve been spending time
evaluating Java programming environments with an eye on the
beginner since not only do the teachers I work with have to be
comfortable with the tool but more importantly they will have to be
able to support the tool for all of their students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One tool we&amp;#39;re likely to use is &lt;a href=&#34;https://repl.it/&#34;&gt;repl.it&lt;/a&gt;. That&amp;#39;s an online environment
for Java and a bunch of other languages. There&amp;#39;s a lot to like about
it and teachers might go with it or a similar cloud based option in
their classes but it&amp;#39;s important that we also prepare teachers to
build programs locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, here&amp;#39;s my criteria and here&amp;#39;s what I found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
The tool has to install easily on all platforms
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I started with my desktop Linux machine. I&amp;#39;m running LinuxMint which
is pretty mainstream and I installed the Java tools using Mint&amp;#39;s
package manager. The packages are openjdk-11 and it looks like running
Java 10. If the IDE or editor I installed  didn&amp;#39;t work off the bat it
was no good. If it installed and I liked it I&amp;#39;ll pass it off to
friends who use Windows and Macs to see if the install there is
equally seamless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
The tool has to be easy to run 
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After install you have to be able to run it easily. No fancy &lt;code&gt;java
-jar blah blah blah&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-3&#34;&gt;
I&amp;#39;m not looking for a professional tool
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professional tools can be too compex and do too much for students. I
was looking for the sweet spot of giving a nice amount of support but
not giving away the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here are the tools I looked at (and you can debate if something
belongs in the other category in some cases):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-4&#34; class=&#34;outline-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-4&#34;&gt;
Editors
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-4&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emacs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gedit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vim&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sublime Text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jedit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-5&#34; class=&#34;outline-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-5&#34;&gt;
IDES
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-5&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eclipse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DrJava&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geany&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BlueJ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IntelliJ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VSCode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JGrasp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-6&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-6&#34;&gt;
Editor vs IDE
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-6&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The line between editor and IDE is a blurry one. I tend to think of an
editor as multi-purpose and multi-language where an also useful for
non programming text realted tasks whereas an IDE comes with more
programming bells and whistles. The truth is, though. that some IDES
can do well with non programming tasks and many editors are pretty
close to IDEs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any event, for a teacher, there&amp;#39;s something to be said for keeping
it &amp;#34;close to the metal&amp;#34; and have them use an editor to edit source
code and compile from the command line. This doesn&amp;#39;t mean they
shouldn&amp;#39;t also see IDEs and perhaps use them with their students but
a teacher should know a little more about what&amp;#39;s going on than just
load a program, write some code, and click run. If a teacher is that
limited you end up in situations similar to that common comment from
people who finish a beginner course on Codecademy - &amp;#34;I finished the
course and I can program in their environment but I don&amp;#39;t know how to
actually make something anywhere else.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-7&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-7&#34;&gt;
The Editors
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-7&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here the idea would be start as I mentioned above. Edit files adn then
compile on the command line. Eventually, though, many of these tools
can be used as IDEs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-8&#34; class=&#34;outline-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-8&#34;&gt;
Emacs
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-8&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/&#34;&gt;https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve got to start with my tool of choice although I can&amp;#39;t really be
unbiased. I think it gets a bad wrap because it&amp;#39;s old and out of the
box looks plain but, yes, you can use your mouse and it does have
menus. The upside is that it can do everything an IDE can do and a
thousand times more. I do email, read rss feeds, maintain my calendar
and more in Emacs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The downside is that it doesn&amp;#39;t do Java well out of the box and kids
like shinier objects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;d start the teachers with Emacs but I&amp;#39;d probably shift
my instruction to using it at some point and show some of the cooler
features (many highlighted in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs/&#34;&gt;Emcacs videos&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-9&#34; class=&#34;outline-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-9&#34;&gt;
Gedit
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-9&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit%0A&#34;&gt;https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit%0A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a plain simple editor. You can bucket in notepad+ and whatever
the basic Mac editor is in here. Nothing special and nothing
fancy. It&amp;#39;s easy enough to load, edit a file and save but not much
more. I&amp;#39;d be fine using it were it not for better options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-10&#34; class=&#34;outline-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-10&#34;&gt;
Vim
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-10&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vim.org/&#34;&gt;https://www.vim.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
No&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-11&#34; class=&#34;outline-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-11&#34;&gt;
Sublime Text
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-11&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sublimetext.com/%0A&#34;&gt;https://www.sublimetext.com/%0A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This was the hotness for a while and it&amp;#39;s a pretty slick editor. I
can&amp;#39;t recommend it for teachers though for two reasons. One is that
it&amp;#39;s not free (although it isn&amp;#39;t expensive). The other is that it&amp;#39;s
not open source. There were other hot editors before sublime and when
their companies folded or sunset the editor all those plugins and
customizations had to be redone on a new platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-12&#34; class=&#34;outline-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-12&#34;&gt;
Atom
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-12&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://atom.io/&#34;&gt;https://atom.io/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Atom&amp;#39;s an editor I want to like. It&amp;#39;s open source and looks pretty
neat but it seems more focused on the JS ecosystem. I couldn&amp;#39;t find
enough Java related plugins to make it better than Gedit although it
was easy to theme and customize the keys. Were I not an Emacs guy I&amp;#39;d
probably use Atom for much of my non-Java development but it doesn&amp;#39;t
seem like a great fit for Java&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-13&#34; class=&#34;outline-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-13&#34;&gt;
Jedit
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-13&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jedit.org/&#34;&gt;http://www.jedit.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This looked like the strongest contender for Java. Not too
complicated. Nice syntax highlighting out of the box. It doesn&amp;#39;t do
completion but that&amp;#39;s arguably a good thing when teaching
programming (incidentally, Emacs doesn&amp;#39;t do completion out of the box
but it can be added so you can up the tools ability as the class moves
along). From my limited explorations you can install plugins like a
Java Linter and you can run a console from inside JEdit which means
you can actually type things like &lt;code&gt;javac file.java&lt;/code&gt; and then run the
program all from within the editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Jedit also has some nice builtin macros for boilerplate code like
setters and getters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-14&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-14&#34;&gt;
IDEs
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-14&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-15&#34; class=&#34;outline-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-15&#34;&gt;
Eclipse 
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-15&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eclipse.org&#34;&gt;https://www.eclipse.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve used eclipse before and as a Java environment, it&amp;#39;s actually
pretty nice. You can customize the keys so I set mine to Emacs. It has
a lot of plugins, you can compile and test your program from within
the IDE and do tons of other things. It&amp;#39;s a VERY nice professional
tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t like it for teaching for three reasons. First, it does too
much. By giving too much professional support kids rely too much on
the tool. Second, it&amp;#39;s made for big projects using build systems not
small AP class programs consisting of one or two files where you run
javac manually. Yes, you can do this in Eclipse but it seems more
awkward. Third, becasue there&amp;#39;s so much going on you need a HUGE
screen and kids and schools might not have enough screen real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s also a fourth reason which is that I installed Eclipse using
LinuxMint&amp;#39;s package manager and it crashed when running. If I&amp;#39;m going
to recommend a teacher roll out a tool that all of their students are
going to install at home on their own, at the very least it has to
install and run seamlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-16&#34; class=&#34;outline-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-16&#34;&gt;
DrJava
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-16&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.drjava.org/&#34;&gt;http://www.drjava.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Like Eclipse, I&amp;#39;ve used DrJava before. It&amp;#39;s similar to DrRacket (nee
Scheme) and Dr. Python. It&amp;#39;s close to perfect. You get highlighting,
helpful error finding, can run your program from within Dr. Java and
more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The killer problem is that I can&amp;#39;t get the latest version to
run. Actually the first problem is that it&amp;#39;s just a jar file so you
have to run it with &lt;code&gt;java -jar drjava.jar&lt;/code&gt;. Beyond that, it didn&amp;#39;t
work out of the box. It loaded but compilign and running didn&amp;#39;t After
some mucking around, I got it to compile but it doesn&amp;#39;t run the
programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is too bad because when it runs it&amp;#39;s a terrific learning
environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-17&#34; class=&#34;outline-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-17&#34;&gt;
BlueJ
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-17&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bluej.org/&#34;&gt;https://bluej.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is another tool that was DOA. I tried the debian package as well
as the jar file. Couldn&amp;#39;t get it working. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have used an older version so I&amp;#39;ll describe that instead just
remember things might be different in the current version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
BlueJ does one thing very well - objects. It visually shows object
creation and relationships. I recall that you can create an opject,
click on it&amp;#39;s box in a visual graph pane, inspect it, instantiate new
ones and in general explore and expirement. If you&amp;#39;re big on OOP and
like Object First by all means check BlueJ out. It&amp;#39;s probably best in
class for that approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, it&amp;#39;s a one trick pony. If you, like me, are not all
in on OOP or an Objects first and all the time approach it&amp;#39;s probably
not the tool for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-18&#34; class=&#34;outline-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-18&#34;&gt;
Geany
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-18&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.geany.org/&#34;&gt;https://www.geany.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I hadn&amp;#39;t heard of this one before but it looks like a contender. It
has a  pretty clean interface and it worked out of the box. I
installed it using the package manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;#34;/img/geany.png&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;250px&amp;#34;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Class browser on the right, files on the left and console (terminal),
compiler status etc on the bottom. It supports some level of
autocomplete but it doesn&amp;#39;t do everything. I&amp;#39;m not sure yet but it
might hit the completion sweet spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It says it does snippets but I haven&amp;#39;t figured that out yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-19&#34; class=&#34;outline-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-19&#34;&gt;
IntelliJ
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-19&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/&#34;&gt;https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
IntelliJ is fro JetBrains. They make a bunch of IDEs each focussed on
a different toolset but all with the same look and feel. You can also
add plugins to each to make them multi-modal. I believe the editor at
the core is JEdit. I&amp;#39;ve used their IDEs in the past and as far as
professional IDEs go I like them. They&amp;#39;re more lightweight than say
Eclipse and don&amp;#39;t need the real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Still, I think it&amp;#39;s too much for a beginner. For example, you can
in theory run your program from the build menu but, much like Eclipse,
it takes you to a configuration screen. I was pretty lost and I&amp;#39;m not
a beginner. Much like Eclipse it&amp;#39;s made for projects not small class
programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I found the Python version of JetBrains IDEs more approachable
probably because the ecosystem is much simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-20&#34; class=&#34;outline-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-20&#34;&gt;
VSCode
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-20&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://code.visualstudio.com/&#34;&gt;https://code.visualstudio.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This one shocked me - I actually found myself liking a Microsoft
product. I guess this really isn&amp;#39;t your father&amp;#39;s Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;#34;/img/vscode.png&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;250px&amp;#34;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Much like Geany it has a clean interface and like Geany you don&amp;#39;t need
a whole Java build system. It does more completions out of the box
which you may or may not like as well as snippets. A single key will
compile and run your program and on top of all that it has en &amp;#34;Emacs&amp;#34;
setting for keybindings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m not sure if I like Geany or VSCode better but I think both are
really good options. I&amp;#39;d probably lean towards Geany due to the less
robust completions. Were I writing code for real rather than teaching,
I&amp;#39;d probably go the other way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-21&#34; class=&#34;outline-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-21&#34;&gt;
JGrasp
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-21&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;#34;/img/vscode.png&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;250px&amp;#34;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
JGrasp feels much the same as the other contenders - Geany and VSCode
but the interface just looks a bit clunkier to me. I know that&amp;#39;s
purely subjective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The biggest difference I&amp;#39;m seeing out of the box is that JGrasp
doesn&amp;#39;t do completions so depending on where you fall with that you
might want Jgrasp for none, Geany for some, and VSCode for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;[EDIT]&lt;/strong&gt; JGrasp has a very cool visualizer built in that will animate
 your proram. Here&amp;#39;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuQowTV0o6s&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of it in action. I&amp;#39;m going to have to
 play with this a bit and see if it pushes JGrasp up over the top for
 me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-22&#34; class=&#34;outline-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-22&#34;&gt;
Processing
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-22&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-4&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://processing.org/&#34;&gt;https://processing.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m not going to talk about processing but I felt that it would be
negligent not to mention it at all. Processing is a IDE, wrapper and
graphical library that&amp;#39;s essentially Java under the hood (although
there are Processing bindings in many other languages probably the
most well known now is &lt;a href=&#34;https://p5js.org/&#34;&gt;p5.js&lt;/a&gt;). It&amp;#39;s great if you want to do graphical
work or base your class around the libraries that are available to
processing which include ones for web cameras, hardware access,
networking, sound and more but it&amp;#39;s not the same as an IDE or editor
for traditional Java development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-23&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-23&#34;&gt;
Notes
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-23&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Just about all of these tools have multiple themes and are fairly
customizable so don&amp;#39;t go by the screenshots above, on the homepages or
what they look like when you first install them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All of the tools I liked installed right out of the box either by
using the package manager or downloading and extracting from an
archive. I can&amp;#39;t say yet if they install as easily on a Mac or Windows
box but since Linux is usually the unloved stepchild of sortware
packaging and distribution my guess is that if anything it&amp;#39;ll be
easier on those platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-24&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-24&#34;&gt;
Conclusions
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-24&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ll always be an Emacs guy. Org-mode is too useful and I can get IDE
like behavior for pretty much any language I want to work in. In some
cases like Clojure, I haven&amp;#39;t seen an IDE that can match Emacs and
Cider, it&amp;#39;s premier Clojure development setup. I also haven&amp;#39;t a Git
interface nearly as slick and powerful as &lt;a href=&#34;https://magit.vc/&#34;&gt;Magit&lt;/a&gt; which works under
Emacs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For my teachers though, I&amp;#39;ll probably start with Geany or VSCode,
switch to Emacs for myself at some point in the program and make sure
to spend time on the command line along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If I missed any editors or IDEs or have something to add on one of the
ones I mentioned, please share in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>How I use Github Classroom</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/github-classroom/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 17 Feb 2019 16:42:48 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/github-classroom/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s been an amazingly unproductive weekend. Mostly because I&amp;#39;ve been
sick with the flu. It sucks but since the rest of the family&amp;#39;s away
anway at least I&amp;#39;m not making everyone miserable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I did manage to stage my next couple of classes and figured that
writing this post wouldn&amp;#39;t take too much energy since it&amp;#39;s mostly a
video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Earlier, I talked about using &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/github-classroom-travis/&#34;&gt;GitHub and TravicCI&lt;/a&gt; and this time around
I show how I use GitHub classroom to set up, disseminate, and collect
assignments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here are the important links you&amp;#39;ll need to set things up yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To register an organization (so that you can use private repos for
free): &lt;a href=&#34;https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new&#34;&gt;https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The main GitHub education page with lots of good stuff and links: &lt;a href=&#34;https://education.github.com/&#34;&gt;https://education.github.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitHub Classroom: &lt;a href=&#34;https://classroom.github.com/&#34;&gt;https://classroom.github.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitHub Classroom Assistant: &lt;a href=&#34;https://classroom.github.com/assistant&#34;&gt;https://classroom.github.com/assistant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The video goes through the entire process but doesn&amp;#39;t really much into
grading. For grading I usually do something like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First I make a file named &lt;strong&gt;repos&lt;/strong&gt; with the names of all the submitted
repos:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-sh&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;cd THEDIRECTORYWITHALLTHEREPOS
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ls &amp;gt; repos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then I&amp;#39;ll use a script that looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-sh&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; i in &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;cat repos&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      cd /tmp/235-assignment-02-02-16-2019-07-25-00/$i
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      NAME&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;grep &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;** Name: &amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; Readme.org | sed &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;s/** Name: //g&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      echo &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;================= &lt;/span&gt;$NAME&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt; ====================&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      make test
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      ./test -s
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      echo &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;\n------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt; report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First I &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; into the repo. Each repo has a file named &lt;strong&gt;Readme.org&lt;/strong&gt; 
which has a line that looks like this &lt;code&gt;** Name: Students Name&lt;/code&gt;. The
line that starts &lt;strong&gt;NAME=&lt;/strong&gt; pulls out the student&amp;#39;s name. It then echos a
separator line with the sutdent&amp;#39;s name in it, builds and runs the
tests. &lt;code&gt;./test -s&lt;/code&gt; runs the doctest tests. The &lt;code&gt;-s&lt;/code&gt; says to print out
the passing tests as well as the failing ones. The output of the whole
loop is saved to a file named report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From there I can look at the report and get a quick overview of who&amp;#39;s
submissions worked and who&amp;#39;s didn&amp;#39;t. I still have to look at the
students actual code but I usually navigate all of that in Emacs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, for grades, I just use a Google Spreadsheet with a script I
wronte to email grades to the students -
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/google-sheets/.&#34;&gt;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/google-sheets/.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can easily adapt this processto use other languages wether you use Unit
Tests or not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, GitHub classroom - check it out. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GitHub Helps Me Help Students</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/github-helps-me-help-students/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Feb 2019 18:55:22 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/github-helps-me-help-students/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Earlier today I was reminded why I love GitHub in support of my
classes. One of my students posted a question about our current
lab. They posted a synopsis of the problem along with the error
message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since we&amp;#39;re all working on GitHub the student&amp;#39;s work was already up
online Since I started using &lt;a href=&#34;https://classroom.github.com&#34;&gt;GitHub Classroom&lt;/a&gt; I was able to quickly
navigate to the repo. This might have been enough but to really in to
the students work I cloned the repo and went into Emacs. Using &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-47-magit/&#34;&gt;Magit&lt;/a&gt;,
Emacs&amp;#39;s Git interface I was quickly able to navigate the project and
also see recent changes or in fact any changes to any of the student&amp;#39;s
project files. I didn&amp;#39;t use it this time but &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-42-git-gutter/&#34;&gt;Git Timemachine&lt;/a&gt; gives an
even slicker way to see the history of changes for a specific file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With these tools it took almost no time to get the lay of the land and
figure out where the student hit the wall. From there I posted a hint to nudge the student in the
right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
GitHub classroom makes the student repo management easy but the other
tools were just plain old Git and Emacs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, for this to work, students have to play their part. If a
student doesn&amp;#39;t push their changes regularly up to GitHub I won&amp;#39;t be
able to see the diffs and help. When they do, it&amp;#39;s a real world tool
that once again has proven to be great at supporting education.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Github Classroom and Travis CI</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/github-classroom-travis/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 02 Feb 2019 09:44:29 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/github-classroom-travis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been using GitHub with my classes since GitHub&amp;#39;s early days. Over
time I&amp;#39;ve gotten my &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/sigcse-2017-github-4/&#34;&gt;workflows down&lt;/a&gt;. I use a combination of shell
scripts - many just written on the fly, GitHub organizations, and some
naming conventions and protocols that have served me well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A few years ago, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://education.github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub Education team&lt;/a&gt; started &lt;a href=&#34;https://classroom.github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub
Classroom&lt;/a&gt;. I looked at it at the time. It was pretty cool but I had my
workflow so I didn&amp;#39;t adopt it. I still very much liked GitHub, the
education team, and the product so I kept tabs on the project as time
passed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This semester I decided to go all in on GitHub Classroom. Why? A
combination of my changing my workflow and part due to the GitHub
education tools and community. At it&amp;#39;s core, GitHub classroom does two
things well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assignment creation and distribution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repo management and organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;#39;d do a couple of posts and videos to show how I&amp;#39;m using
everything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s the first one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Interestingly enough I&amp;#39;m not going to talk at all about GitHub
classroom for the remainder of this post. Instead I&amp;#39;m going to talk
about TravisCI (&lt;a href=&#34;https://travis-ci.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://travis-ci.com/&#34;&gt;https://travis-ci.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://travis-ci.org/&#34;&gt;https://travis-ci.org/&lt;/a&gt;). Travis is a platform for continuous
intergration. The idea is pretty simple. After setting things up,
whenever you push code to a repo that Travis is watching, Travis
starts a container for your repo and runs one or more scripts against
the repo. This usually means tests. It turns out that this can be a
useful sanity check for students. It&amp;#39;s true that they can run tests on
their assignments before submitting them but this way it&amp;#39;s done
automatically and after they submit. They can be sure that what
they&amp;#39;ve submitted actually works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First you have to link your GitHub accoutn with Travis. To do this,
just go to travis-ci.org and log in using GitHub. You can then set a
bunch of options including which repos to run Travis on. The interface
at travis-ci.com looks similar but a bit nicer. The .org site is free
for open source or public repos  (as is the .com site, I think) but
the good people at Travis will give you rights to use private repos
for educational purposes for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The only other thing you have to do is create a &lt;a href=&#34;https://yaml.org/&#34;&gt;YAML&lt;/a&gt; file named
 &lt;code&gt;.travis.yml&lt;/code&gt; in your repo. Here&amp;#39;s one I&amp;#39;m using to test C++ projecs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-yaml&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;language&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;cpp&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;compiler&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;clang&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  - &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;make test&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  - &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;./test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This tells Travis to use the clang compiler (as opposed to, say g++)
and then run &lt;code&gt;make test&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;./test&lt;/code&gt;. If all the tests pass you
get a green check and an email and you&amp;#39;re good to go. If they don&amp;#39;t
you get a red X and also an email. Of course for this particular
configuration to work you need &lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt; and everything else needed
to build the tests in the repo. In my case, I&amp;#39;m using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/onqtam/doctest&#34;&gt;doctest&lt;/a&gt; for tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Travis has support for a whole bunch of languages including Java,
Python, and JavaScript and all of those have nice testing frameworks
so regardless of what you&amp;#39;re teaching with, Travis could be easily
integrated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In this video I show how I&amp;#39;m using TravisCI and also a simple Python
setup. In the next post I&amp;#39;ll get back to GitHub classroom and how
TravisCI integrates into it.&lt;/p&gt;
