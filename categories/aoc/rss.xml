&lt;p&gt;
Time for some final thoughts on &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/&#34;&gt;Advent of Code 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This was my sixth Advent of Code but the first time I completed all 25
days. Better than last year&amp;#39;s 31 and a whole lot better than my
weakest effort of 11 stars in 2017. I managed to find the time to
finish all but two on the day they were released and finished those
two on Christmas morning. This was also the first year I wrote all my
solutions in Clojure and I also made a bunch of blog posts and videos
(linked on the bottom of this post).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From my point of view 2020 was the best AoC to date and I&amp;#39;m not just
saying that because I finished all the problems. Well, maybe I am but
it&amp;#39;s really because the content and release of content lent itself to
my completing all the problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before jumping in to my specific commentary I want to remind readers
that anyone&amp;#39;s perceptions of an event like this will be biased. If
there&amp;#39;s an aspect that I particularly liked you can bet there&amp;#39;s
someone else out there who didn&amp;#39;t like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Overall content
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As usual a wide range of topics were covered including binary numbers,
pattern matching, simulation, dynamic programming, mathy stuff,
parsing, graph algorithms and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I didn&amp;#39;t find myself totally lost on any questions. There were some
problems that at least to me seemed to require graph algorithms and
one where dynamic programming or at least memoization was a boon but
for the most part it seemed that problems were indeed
approachable. Even the math day that had a bunch of reddit chatter
over the Chinese Remainder Theorem could be done without knowing about
the CRM. That was good because I had never heard of it (and if any of
the redditors who mentioned that it should  common knowledge, it
shouldn&amp;#39;t - I have an undergrad in CS and a Masters in CS along wit 30
years of teaching and this is the first time I&amp;#39;ve seen it). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In past years there always seemed to be a few problems that you needed
some preexisting knowledge to attempt. I had no problem with that - no
need to have  to finish all the problems and there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong
with hitting up reddit, learning something new and then tackling the
problem. This year it seemed that the problems more directly led to
the knowledge. I&amp;#39;ll talk about this more later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
Problem size
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For the most part the problems were the perfect size for me. I&amp;#39;d read
the problems when I woke up, work on part 1 after my run and then part
2 later in the day - at least that was the ideal - bugs and life
sometimes got in the way. None of the problems required pages and
pages of code for the solutions which I liked. Problems were clever
and interesting but led to moderately sized solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In past years, the weekend problems were longer and/or harder. The
logic being that there&amp;#39;s more time to work on them. I never liked
that. AoC is great but it&amp;#39;s an add on. It&amp;#39;s an add on to work during
the week but it&amp;#39;s an add on to family time on the weekend. I liked
that this year the only weekend problem that was much larger and longer
was day 20 - the image reconstruction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is not to say that some problems didn&amp;#39;t take a good deal of time
but rather that once you had an approach you didn&amp;#39;t sit down and say
&amp;#34;oh man, now I have to write hundreds of lines of code to implement
this.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-3&#34;&gt;
particularly nice problems 
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In spite of my not finishing part 2 until the last day, I loved day
20 - Jurassic Jigsaw. It was a little long and I spend more time than
I care to admit on debugging a really silly error but I loved the
problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, it had staged difficulty -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parse the data into a reasonable representation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do a partial edge matching for part 1 (not so hard)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the harder / longer matching to reconstruct the image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the border and solve the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, you actually discovered something - you &lt;strong&gt;found&lt;/strong&gt; sea
monsters!!!! You had a problem with an &amp;#34;unknown&amp;#34; solution and you
figured it out. Contrast that with say, day 2 where you just had to
validate passwords. That was also a fun problem but there was no big
reveal. It was really cool to decode your image and actaully find the
hidden monsters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Day 16 and 21 allowed for similar discovery at the end but not quite
as cool. I liked 16 very much but had a hard time getting my head
around the example for 21. Still a cool problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-4&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-4&#34;&gt;
Teachable stuff
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-4&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As usual, I found a lot that I liked as a teacher in AoC. I love that
many of the problems introduce problem solvers to new things. For me,
the Chinese Remainder Theorem was new even though I only discovered it
via the subreddit. Cellular Automata was prominently featured
this year, binary explicitly mentioned as was recursion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The recursion problem was particularly nice. The setup led to and, if
I recall, explicitly mentioned recursion. It also talks about a key
challenge - data mutability. The question states that after returning
from a &amp;#34;subgame&amp;#34; - the recursion - you have to continue the original
game from where it left off - state management. If you&amp;#39;re language
passes references in your calls this could lead to trouble. I&amp;#39;m
guessing (hoping?) that for people who solved that day who were new to
recursion got a deeper understanding than just through the usual n!
and such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another thing I liked was the spiraling. That, in teacher talk, is
when you go back to an earlier topic. This year had three questions
based on Cellular Autoamta. The first was the basic, the next took you
to a higher dimension and the third to a different shape. Each one
reviewed and extend fro the earlier problem. I loved it. This might
sound similar to last year&amp;#39;s intcode but the difference is that evne
if you didn&amp;#39;t complete the earlier problems you had a shot at the
latter ones. With Intcode if you had something wrong with your earlier
interpreter you were out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The allergens problem also allowed for the use of the same method you
used to solve the boarding pass problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Loved the spiraling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I could probably go on but this post is already long enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-5&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-5&#34;&gt;
Links
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-5&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ll finish off with links to my earlier posts on Advent of Code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Already looking forward to next year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Teacher Looks at Advent of Code 2020 - Days 21 and 24</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-21-24/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 24 Dec 2020 11:43:14 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-21-24/</guid>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/24&#34;&gt;Day 24&lt;/a&gt; didn&amp;#39;t take that much time so I had a chance to go back and
finish &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/21&#34;&gt;day 21&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As usual, all my code is up &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/advent2020&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Day 21
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/21&#34;&gt;Problem Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It took me a while to get my head around this example. You have a set
of recipes. Each recipe has a list of ingredients and a list of
allergens. Your job for part 1 was basically to determine which
ingredients don&amp;#39;t contain any allergens. Part 2 had you determining
which ingredient had which allergen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part of what I think made this hard was that ingredients were just
random strings of letters as opposed to actual ingredients or at least
pronounceable words or letter strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The key part of the description as that each allergen was present in
&lt;strong&gt;exactly one&lt;/strong&gt; ingredient and each ingredient had &lt;strong&gt;at most&lt;/strong&gt; one
allergen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, for part 1, the tact was for each allergen, take all the recipes
that had it. In the example, the first and second recipes had
dairy (one indexing). Since only one ingredient can have the dairy
allergen the that ingredient must be in both lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you take all the recipes that have the dairy allergen and take each
of their lists of ingredients as a set and find all their
intersections, you&amp;#39;ll be left with all the ingredients that can have
the dairy allergen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Do this with all the allergens and you&amp;#39;ll have all the ingredients
that could contain them. The other igredients are safe and lead to the
answer to part 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part 2 had you identifying each ingredient / allergen
pair. Fortunately, the data set we ended up with for part 1 - each
allergen and it&amp;#39;s list of possible ingredients was made to order. One
of them had only one ingredient per allergen. We could identify that
one and then remove that ingredient from the remaining allergen&amp;#39;s
lists. Then repeat to find the next one and then the next. This is
similar to the solution to day 16. Of course this isn&amp;#39;t a general
solution but fortunately the data was all set up for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
Day 24
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/24&#34;&gt;Problem Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back to Cellular Automata!!!!!! The catch this time is the world is a
hex grid. This means that each cell has six neighbors so using a 2D
array or similar representation seems like an even worse idea than it
was for the 3D and 4D problems earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even before representing the world parsing was an issue. Since a given
cell can have neighbors to the east, west, northeast, northwest,
southeast or southwest, instructions are given with a line of &amp;#34;moves&amp;#34;
describing a tile to flip starting from 0,0. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For example, the line &amp;#34;EEE&amp;#34; would move three east from the origin and
flip that tile while &amp;#34;ESEE&amp;#34; would move one east, one southest and then
one further east and flipt the tile there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fortunately, this wasn&amp;#39;t too bad. As we traverse down the line, if we
see an &lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt; or a &lt;strong&gt;w&lt;/strong&gt; then the instruction is one character so we add
the instruction to a list of steps an then continue. Otherwise the
instruction is 2 characters so we take 2 and add the instruction adn
then proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next was the data representation. It seemed that a list of live cells
would again be the best solution. I figured on using this mapping: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;E&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(-2,0)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;W&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(2,0)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;NE&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(-1,-1)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;NW&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(1,-1)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;SE&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(-1,1)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;SW&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(1,1)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I later found out that this is called &amp;#34;double coordinates.&amp;#34; Since
we&amp;#39;re not storing the full hex grid there&amp;#39;s no waste anyway and I
wasn&amp;#39;t planning on making a visualization so I didn&amp;#39;t worry about how
this would map to an actual screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, finding the coordinate of a tile was pretty easy. In Clojure
it&amp;#39;s: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-clojure&#34; data-lang=&#34;clojure&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;;; assume deltas is a lookup dictionary of the above mapping&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;defn &lt;/span&gt;get-tile-location [steps]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    (reduce (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;fn &lt;/span&gt;[loc step]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;              (map + loc (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;deltas&lt;/span&gt;  step))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;              ) [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;] steps))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In Python it would look more like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# assume deltas is a dictionary with the above mapping&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# and steps is a list of instructions [&amp;#34;e&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;w&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;se&amp;#34;, etc]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; step &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; steps:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      loc &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; [sum(x) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; x &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; zip(loc, deltas[step])]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We can now convert any input line of instructions to a coordinate. If
we write a routine to flip a tile we can now set up our world and
answer part 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part 2 involved basically turning the part 1 world into a cellular
automaton. Fortunately, this was easy given the solution to earlier CA
problems. It as just a matter of updating the get-neighbors routine
and the rule to go from one generation to the next and we&amp;#39;re done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I enjoyed this - it was a nice twist on the earlier CA
questions. First we had a simple CA, then higher dimensions and now
changing the layout of the world but still within 2 dimensions. Once
we had a way of representing a tile and mapping from a tile to its
neighbors we had already solved the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One more day to go but it&amp;#39;s been a nice run of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A few days have past so it&amp;#39;s time for an update. Two more days to go
and while I haven&amp;#39;t completed all the problems, I have accumulated 43
stars which is a personal best. Given the nature of the problems I&amp;#39;m
missing, I might even go back and do them at some point. Of course, I
may very well also just crash out on the final two days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As usual, all my code is up &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/advent2020&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Day 19
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/19&#34;&gt;Problem Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not a whole lot to say about this one. It&amp;#39;s the weekend and AoC has
traditionally had longer / harder problems over the weekends. I was
surprised when the first weekend&amp;#39;s problems - 12 and 13 weren&amp;#39;t
significantly longer than the surrounding days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I read over this and it screamed &lt;strong&gt;parser&lt;/strong&gt; and to be honest, I really
wasn&amp;#39;t up for writing a parser on a Saturday morning. Instead, I
cheaped out.  I looked for a Clojure parser generator and found
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/engelberg/instaparse&#34;&gt;instaparse&lt;/a&gt;. What&amp;#39;s more, instaparse supported input in the form of the
provided AoC data so I literally just had to read the grammar into
instaparse and run it on the data for the answer. Part 2 was pretty
much the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
Day 20
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/20&#34;&gt;Problem Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This was the big one. Basically taking 144 tiles and figuring out how
to form them in an image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I finished part 1. I read in all the tiles and then for each, compared
it&amp;#39;s edges with the edges of the other tiles (and the reverse of the
edges to account for transformations). This told me how many other
tiles each tile connects with. Central tiles each connect to 4 other
ties, edges, to three but corners only to 2. Part 1 just had you find
the corners so it wasn&amp;#39;t too big a deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part 2 involves assembling the image and then finding sea monsters. I
haven&amp;#39;t done this yet. Armed with the corner, it should be easy to
find the top row and then build the image going down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think it&amp;#39;s going to be a bear to code though since each tile has to
be transformed via flipping and/or rotating into the correct
orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m hoping to get back to it. We&amp;#39;ll see though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-3&#34;&gt;
Day 21
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/21&#34;&gt;Problem Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Haven&amp;#39;t done this one yet. Just couldn&amp;#39;t get my head around the
example on an early Monday morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;ll finish question 20 but I do really hope to get
back to give this one a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-4&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-4&#34;&gt;
Day 22
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-4&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/22&#34;&gt;Problem Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part 1 here was pretty straightforward - you had a few rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if player 1&amp;#39;s deck is empty, player 2 wins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if player 2&amp;#39;s deck is empty, player 1 wins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;otherwise both players draw a card and whoever drew the higher card gets both, they go on the
back of the winners deck and you continue play.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it. Basically just run the simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part 2 added a recursive subgame. Under certain circumstances you
pause the current game and do a little subgame. The catch is that you
have to save the state of the current game and when the subgame or
subgames end, you continue the suspended game from where you left off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This means that if you are representing your decks with arrays or some
other data structure where you can change the elements you have to be
careful. In Clojure, however, where data is immutable by default you
don&amp;#39;t have to worry about that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was basically able to just rewrite my play routine for the new
rules and whenever we had to go to a subgame, I just made a
traditional recursive call. My guess is that if I had coded this up
originally in Java or C++ I probably would have had a harder time
going from part 1 to part 2. On the other hand, there were some
problems with Java or C++ would have made my part 1 to part 2
transitions easier - depends on the problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-5&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-5&#34;&gt;
Day 23
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-5&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/23&#34;&gt;Problem Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This was the fun one - at least from a teacher&amp;#39;s point of view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Like day 22 you had to implement a game. You set up a bunch of
numbered cups in a circle and then: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remove the three cups right after the current cup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find out where they should be reinserted based on the game rules
(see the problem link for details)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reinsert those three cups at that reinsertion point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;move from the current cup to the next cup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did part 1 using a simple list and list manipulations. I used
Clojure but the python equivalent would be to have a list representing
all the cups, move around ti with mod, and remove cups and add them
using slices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# given board = [3,8,9,1,2,5,4,6,7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# to get the next board state&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  current &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; board[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  to_remove &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; board[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  remaining &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; board[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;:]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  idx &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; find_target(board,remove)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  newboard &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; remaining[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;:idx] &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; to_remove &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; remaining[idx:] &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; [current]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I might have the indexing a little off and the &lt;code&gt;find_target&lt;/code&gt; routine
isn&amp;#39;t shown adn might have different parameters. As I&amp;#39;ve said, I wrote
my solution in Clojure. This should give the general idea though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You basically had to run through 10 turns to find the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part 2 added a twist - the game board was now &lt;strong&gt;one million&lt;/strong&gt; in size
and you had to run the simulation through &lt;strong&gt;ten million&lt;/strong&gt; turns. No way
was my part 1 solution going to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The problem called for something that required fewer list traversals
and builds and where it would be quick and easy to find a given
element. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My first thought was to build a traditional linked list. That would
help but it would also require a number of linear traversals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next thought? How about a dictionary? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you set up a dictionary where the keys are the nodes and the values
represent the pointer to the next node you could really quickly and
easily both traverse and manipulate the data set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For example, if your board was [3,8,9,1] then you&amp;#39;d use this
dictionary to represent it - remember the 1 wraps back around to
the 3.
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  nodes &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; {&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;           &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;           &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;           &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So if you&amp;#39;re current node was represented in a variable &lt;code&gt;current&lt;/code&gt; the
three nodes you&amp;#39;ll remove would be &lt;code&gt;[nodes[current],
noeds[nodes[current]], nodes[nodes[nodes[current]]] ]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As an added bonus, the question pointed out that your data set would
have every positive integer represented once. That is, part 1 had a 9
item list with all the values 1 through 9 and the million item one had
values 1 through 1 million. This makes finding the insertion point
both easy and fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It turns out that I think the dictionary based solution is actually
cleaner than the list one in addition to being faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This solution was no speed demon - still took ~40 seconds to get an
answer but that&amp;#39;s good enough for me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of the problems I wrote up today, this one was my favorite. Students
typically think of data structures as what they are - if they have an
array, use it as an array, a linked list is a linked list and a
dictionary or hash table is, well, you know. If you need a linked
list, you need to make a traditional linked list - not so. this is a
great example of using a dictionary as a hash table. There are
conceptual data structures and actual in computer
representations. Often you use the implementation directly - use a
hash table to store data for lookup or use an array to represent a
list. It can be very empowering though when the student sees that
the implementations are just tools in the belt and they can be used in
all sorts of interesting ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>A Teacher Looks at Advent of Code 2020 - Days 17 and 18</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-1718/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Dec 2020 12:35:57 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-1718/</guid>
      <description>
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Day 17
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/17&#34;&gt;Day 17&lt;/a&gt; brought back Cellular Automata. It was a nice follow up to &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day11/&#34;&gt;day
11&lt;/a&gt;. In my &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day11/&#34;&gt;writeup&lt;/a&gt; I talked about data representation - how a Cellular
Automoton like Conway&amp;#39;s game of life is a nice 2D array project in a
class like APCS-A but multi dimensional arrays are only one way to
represent a cellular automaton. Day 17 really drove that home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The actual rules were pretty simple - if a cell is active and has 2 or
3 active neighbors it stays active. If it&amp;#39;s inactive and has three
active it becomes active. Otherwise the cell is inactive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The catch for part 1 is that this CS is in three dimensions. Each and
a cell&amp;#39;s neighbors are defined as all coordinates that differ by one
in any of the three dimensions. So, if a cell is at an (x,y,z) location
it&amp;#39;s neighbors will be at (x+1,y,z), (x-1,y,z), (x+1,y+1,z),
(x+1,y-1,z), etc. for 26 neighbors in all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You could use a list  within a list within a list or a three
dimensional array to represent your world but that&amp;#39;s tricky and error
prone. What&amp;#39;s worse, part 2 took the CA into the fourth dimension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Better is to just keep a list or set of active cells. Then the problem
becomes pretty easy. You need to be able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find all of a cell&amp;#39;s neighbors - this is pretty easy because you
can iterate over all the +1 and -1 possibilities for each of the x,
y, and z values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find all the potential cells for the next state - this is also
pretty easy because it&amp;#39;s the set of all cells that are currently
active along with all of their neighbors. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Count a given cell&amp;#39;s active neighbors - this is easy once you&amp;#39;ve
done the find neighbors routine. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A way to test if a cell is active which is just checking to see if
it&amp;#39;s in your active cells list or set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, it&amp;#39;s pretty easy to run the CA: 
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# pythonesque pseudocode &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;potential_cells &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; find_all_neighbors(current_active_cells)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;new_cells &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; []
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; cell &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; potential_cells: 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  n &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; count_neighbors(cell)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; is_active(cell) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; (n&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; n&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;):
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    new_cells&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;append(cell)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;elif&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; is_active(cell)) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; n&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    new_cells&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;append(cell)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then you just have to run generate new states until you get the
answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part 2 extended the CA to 4 dimensions. If you had a multidimensional
array this would get super message but with a list of active cells,
the changes are minimal - just add an extra coordinate, update getting
the neighbors and you&amp;#39;re good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a case of where thinking through your data representation can
be a big win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Clojure code &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/advent2020/blob/main/src/day17.clj&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
Day 18
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/18&#34;&gt;Day 18&lt;/a&gt; was all about evaluating math expressions. For part 1 you had
parenthesized expressions consisting of numbers * and + that you had
to evaluate but you had to do it by first doing parens then left to
right - multiplication was not a higher precedence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This sounds like a parsing first problem but it turns out I was able
to exploit some of Clojure&amp;#39;s language features. Looking at the
subreddit after solving it seems that a bunch of other languages also
have features that could be exploited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Clojure represents data (and programs) as &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression&#34;&gt;S-Expressions&lt;/a&gt; - basically
stuff in parens. As a prefix language, instead of writing 10+20, in
Clojure you&amp;#39;d write &lt;code&gt;(+ 10 20)&lt;/code&gt;, that is  run the plus function on 10
and 20. If you have something lie &lt;code&gt;(+ 10 (* 20 3))&lt;/code&gt;, Clojure has to
evaluate the inner S-Expression (sexp) before it can add that to +10
so Clojure can do the parsing for us. We can take an input string and
convert it to an sexp using &lt;code&gt;read-string&lt;/code&gt;  but if we just try to do
&lt;code&gt;(read-string &amp;#34;1 + 2 + 3&amp;#34;)&lt;/code&gt; we&amp;#39;d get an error because &amp;#34;1 + 2 + 3&amp;#34;
isn&amp;#39;t a valid sexp so we just surround it by parens:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-clojure&#34; data-lang=&#34;clojure&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;def &lt;/span&gt;equation-sexp (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;read-string&lt;/span&gt; (str &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;(&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;1 + 2 * 3 + (4 * 5 )&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;)&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The above would leave us with the sexp (1 + 2 * 3 + (4 * 5 )).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next, forgetting the inner parens, we can write a function that will
evaluate an sexp of the form (1 + 2 * 3 + …) etc. Basically, this can
be done with a reduce. Start with the first value then take the rest
of the list two at a time, the first of each pair is an operator and
the second is an operand so apply the operand to the other number in
the pair and your overall result so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In Clojure it looks like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-clojure&#34; data-lang=&#34;clojure&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;defn &lt;/span&gt;part1-eval [f &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; r]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  (reduce (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;fn &lt;/span&gt;[ans [op next]]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;            (apply op [ans next] )) f (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;partition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; r)))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next, we insert that function name to the start of each sexp so 
(1 + 2 * 3 + (4 * 5*)) becomes (part1-eval 1 + 2 * 3 + (part1-eval 4 *
5)). Finally we can do a  Clojure &lt;strong&gt;eval&lt;/strong&gt; on this form which will run
part1-eval on the rest of the sexp which will first run part1-eval on
the 4 * 5, that will return the 20 and then the first part1-eval will
finish it&amp;#39;s calculations to give you the answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part 2 was similar but there you had to perform addition before
multiplication. All that was necessary was write a part2-eval function
that would stand in for the part1-eval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The idea is to take an sexp like (1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5) we first split this
list around the * this gives us (1 + 2) (&lt;strong&gt;) (3 + 4) (&lt;/strong&gt;) (5). We then
filter this to remove the non numbers which gives (1 2) () (3 4) (5)
(). Then we remove the empty lists: (1 2) (3 4) (5). Add the elements
of each list: 3 7 5 and then multiply them together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All the code is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/advent2020/blob/main/src/day18.clj&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I like day 17 a lot or some variant for students to discuss data
representations but I think 18 is a little more advanced and probably
wouldn&amp;#39;t touch it in an early CS class - it was fun to work through
though :-). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>A Teacher Looks at Advent of Code 2020 - day 16</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day16/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Dec 2020 17:12:56 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>
&lt;p&gt;
Today&amp;#39;s problem was a fun one to solve. Why was it fun? Stay tuned,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The basic gist is that you have a plane ticket which is a set of
numbers but you don&amp;#39;t know which number maps to which category - row,
seat, gate, etc. You also know the number ranges for each
category. For example, row might be a number between 6 and 11 or 33
through 44 while a seat might be 13 through 40 or 45 through 50. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, you also can see a number of nearby tickets - each also as
tring of numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For part 1 you had to determine how many of the nearby tickets are
valid. A ticket is valid if all the numbers on it fall into at least
one category range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/16&#34;&gt;full description&lt;/a&gt; for all the details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First up - parsing - a little cumbersome but not too bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Split the input into the three main sections - categories, your
ticket, nearby tickets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convert the categories into a usable form&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convert your ticket into a list of numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convert the nearby tickets into a list of tickets each one being a
list of numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking each step in turn and it&amp;#39;s not too bad - particularly if you&amp;#39;re
comfortable with regular expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
part 1
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Representing the categories leads us to our first interesting
decision. How will we test to see if a ticket is valid and based on
that how will we represent the categories?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Each category has two ranges connected with an &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;example&#34;&gt;
row: 6-11 or 33-44
seat: 13-40 or 45-50
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One could make a construct to hold the bounds, loop through the nearby
tickets and for each value, run an if statement with the two ranges
connected by an &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is where a class can talk about code vs data - a topic I&amp;#39;m really
fond of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Instead of taking the above range and having some test like: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; number &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; ticket:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (number &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; low1 &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; number &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; high1) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; \
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;     (number &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; low2 &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; number &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; high2):
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;       do something&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
or specifically for the row example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; number &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; ticket:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (number &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; number &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; \
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;     (number &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;33&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; number &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;44&lt;/span&gt;):
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;       do something&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
you could make a set with all the possible seats  and then just test
to see if the seat was in the set: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;r1 &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; set( range(low1,high&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;r2 &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; set( range(low2,hight2&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;valid_seats &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; r1&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;union(r2)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# then later&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; seat &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; valid_seats:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  do something&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I just find this more elegant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For part 1 I just made a big set with all the valid seats and then
checked each ticket to see if each if its numbers were in the valid
seats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
part 2
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For part 2 first you had to remove all the invalid tickets from the
nearby tickets. Since you figured out how to identify a valid ticket
in part one this shouldn&amp;#39;t be too ahrd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then we have to sleuth out which column from the tickets represented
which category. This would make a great group activity in a class,
particularly with an interactive language. This is a great data
exploration and representation problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To get more data, I thought I&amp;#39;d write a routine to pull all of one
column from the nearby tickets. Then I could see if all the values in
that row were valid for a particular category. For example, are all
the first numbers of all the tickets valid numbers for row. If so,
that column could represent row. Of course it could also represent
something else as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now that i could test to see if a column is valid for a category I
decided to build some data. I built a list of all the possible
categories for each row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part of it looked sort of like this (but in clojure):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[ [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;, [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;wagon&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;arrival-station&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;] ],
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;, [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;wagon&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;arrival-station&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;route&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;train&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;row&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;]]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Examining this table, I noticed that one row had only one category,
another had only 2 then one three etc. Great - we can now solve this
by plugging in the row we know, then the next one, then the next etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The explorations led to an easy answer. I sorted the list and looped
through. At each iteration I: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added the current category and its associated row to the solution
set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed that category from the rest of the lines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When done we had a dictionary with a mapping from category to
row. From there it was pretty simple to find the part 2 answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Lots of good stuff here. I love the data explorations and the way it
can lead to a pretty straightforward solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Full solution in clojure can be found here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/16&#34;&gt;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So far I&amp;#39;ve managed to complete each day - 32 stars. That beats my 31
from last year adn my top year of 40 back in 2016. Tomorrow I give my
last exams and grading ca really begin so we&amp;#39;ll see if I can keep
going but so it&amp;#39;s been a fun Advent of Code year so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>A teacher looks at Advent of Code day 14</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day14/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 14 Dec 2020 14:30:47 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day14/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Time for &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/14&#34;&gt;Day 14&lt;/a&gt;!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I didn&amp;#39;t write up day 12 but here&amp;#39;s a Clojure &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8fvaAZRtts&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; runthrough. I also
didn&amp;#39;t write up day 13 mostly because I hacked together my part 2 in
Python and still want to rewrite it in decent clojure. In any event,
all my solutions are up on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/advent2020&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Day 14 had a few interesting things going on. At its core it&amp;#39;s a small
machine simulator where you have to deal with binary numbers. One of
the rubs is that the numbers are 36 digits which could be a problem if
your language / machine uses 32 bits to represent integers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Right off, assuming you have large enough ints you have an interesting
choice. Do you work with the data them as numbers or do you just do
string manipulations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I decided to do part 1 as numbers which leads to a nice little
exercise of using bitwise logic operations to turn bits on or off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part 2 was better solved, at least for me using string
manipulations. That part had a nice little recursive subproblem -
mapping wildcard values in the &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; to all the possible combinations
of zeros and ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Both problems also had a bit of fun parsing and, at least for me, a
few neat clojure constructs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think you could turn this problem into a fun set of class

      <title>A teacher looks at Advent of Code 2020 - Day 11</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Today was &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton&#34;&gt;Cellular Automaton&lt;/a&gt; Day at Advent of Code. You have a world
that&amp;#39;s usually represented as a grid of cells. Each cell can be in a
certain state. Given a certain state, the next state is determined by
simple rules like for a given cell how many of it&amp;#39;s neighbors are the
same color. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The most popular Cellular Automat is probably &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life&#34;&gt;Conway&amp;#39;s Game of Life&lt;/a&gt;
where each cell can be either alive or dead in a given generation and
in the next generation the state will be determined by how many of its
neighbors are currently dead or alive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve always liked teaching with Celluar Automata and explored it
deeply in the intro course I designed at Stuy. NetLogo is perfect for
representing a CA (&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-01-15-shift-image/&#34;&gt;old post&lt;/a&gt;) and we even do things like using a CS to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-01-17-maze-ca/&#34;&gt;solve a maze&lt;/a&gt;. Good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today&amp;#39;s problem set up a CA where each cell can be one of three
states - floor, occupied chair, unoccupied chair. The floor never
changed but the chairs can change from occupied to unoccupied and back
based on neighbors. I actually really like teh question. It&amp;#39;s posed as
passengers prefer to sit in s eats next to other empty seats which is
true and the overall problem is much more realistic and therefor
accessible than Conway&amp;#39;s game of life. I think I might lead with it if
I do CA again with my students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can find my Clojure solutions &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/advent2020/blob/main/src/day11.clj&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. They were pretty
straightforward. I spend too much time going down the &amp;#34;learn how to
write a lazy sequence in Clojure&amp;#34; rabbit hole for part 2 before just
writing it in a more traditional way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To me there are a couple of interesting things at play when teaching
CA. The first is state management and synchronization. When beginners
work on a CA they frequently look at a cell, figure out it&amp;#39;s next
generation value and then replace the cell with its new value. Then,
later they look at a neighboring cell and when that cell looks at its
neighbors it gets the changed value not the original one. Clearly a
problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Writing a CA makes it clear that you have to keep your state clean
while you build a new state for the next generation. That&amp;#39;s an
important lesson to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The other interesting teaching point is with data representation. CA
is frequently taught as a 2D array exercise. This makes sense -
simulations like Conway&amp;#39;s Game of Life work perfectly in a 2D array
and if you&amp;#39;re doing graphics with your class you can also get cool
animations through the generations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That said, there are other valid representations that could be
superior at times. You might have a list of living cells or a hash
tabe of cells if you have more than 2 living states. This can be far
superior from a space efficiency point of view if you don&amp;#39;t have a lot
of living cells compared with your world size - say you have a CA with
a theoretically unlimited size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, there it is - thoughts on today&amp;#39;s problem. As I said, it was
pretty straightforward but I also really like the setup and will
probably use it in class at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Teacher looks at Advent of Code 2020 - days 9 and 10</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day0910/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Dec 2020 16:52:45 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day0910/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
As we get closer to the end of the semester and time becomes scarcer
I&amp;#39;m wondering how many more I&amp;#39;ll finish. Barely had time to do days 9
and 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not much to say about &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/9&#34;&gt;day 9&lt;/a&gt; Part one was basically a rehash of day 1
part 1 but with a sliding widow. Part 2? I just brute force tried all
the subranges. I meant to go back to try to improve the solution but
didn&amp;#39;t have a chance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Clojure code can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/advent2020/blob/main/src/day09.clj&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/10&#34;&gt;Day 10&lt;/a&gt; was more interesting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I misread part 1 but ultimately, my solution was to: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read in the data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sort it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prepend a 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;append an additional value of the max + 3 to the end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then loop through comparing adjacent values and keep track of the
differences which can be 1, 2, or 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;data&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;[ int(x) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; x &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; open(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;../data/sample10-1.dat&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;readlines()]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;data&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;sort()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;data&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;insert(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;data&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;append(max(data)&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;j&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; i &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; range(len(data)&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;):
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    diff&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;data[i&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;data[i]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    j[diff&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;j[diff&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;print(j)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part 2 was where the fun starts - how many combinations of adapters
will take you from the start to the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For example, if we had adapters with voltages 1,4,5,6 given the
problem constraints that you can only connect an adapter to another
with a &amp;#34;joltage&amp;#34; of up to three less, you can only use the 1 voltage 1
way (coming from the source of 0).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
4 can connect to only 1 so it can only be used 1 way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
5 can connect to 4 so it too can only be used 1 way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
6 is a change, it can connect to 5 or 4 so you could chain either
6–&amp;gt;5–&amp;gt;4–&amp;gt;1 or 6–&amp;gt;4–&amp;gt;1 so you can get to 6 two ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If a student knows recursion and recursive search it&amp;#39;s easy enough to
code something that tries all the paths but it&amp;#39;s going to get very
slow very fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With a couple of insights though this can lead to a nice dynamic
programming type solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First thing to notice is that, similar to day 7, instead of looking at
how many adapters a lower joltage adapter can lead to we can look at how
many lower joltage adapters a given adapter could have come from. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To do this, we can look at the adapters as a graph. We can build a
dictionary where the keys are the adapter joltages and the entries are
the lower joltage adapters it can connect with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;        &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; (j&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;len(data) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; data[i] &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; data[j] &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;):
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;            j&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;j&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;        graph[current]&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;data[i&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;:j]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; graph
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;rmap &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; build_reverse_map(data)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Line 3 reverses the list then for each item in the list, lines 6
through 8 find the adapters it can connect with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The next insight is that instead of calculating all the possibilities
we can build them a step at a time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Consider the first voltage from our above example of 1,4,5,6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
1 – it can only go to 0 so 0 is its only &amp;#34;neighbor&amp;#34; in the graph. We
can only get there 1 way so we can store 1 in ways[1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
4 – same deal - its only neighbor is 1. You can only get to 1 one way
so you can only get to 4 1 way - store it in ways[4]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
5 – same deal, ways[5] = 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
6 - now six is different. It has 2 neighbors - 5 and 4. You can get to
5 one way and 4 one way so we can get to 6 two ways (the sum of the
ways to get to each of it&amp;#39;s neighbors). Store that in ways[6]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Go through all the nodes and then ways[the last node] will have your
answer:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ways&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;{}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; d &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; data:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    ways[d]&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; d &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; data[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;:]:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    neighbors &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; rmap[d]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    sum &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; n &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; neighbors:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;        sum &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; sum &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; ways[n]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    ways[d]&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Relatively straightforward and lightning fast. Dynamic programming
can be really hard to teach but I think this problem might be a good
one to do with an advanced data structures class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For comparison, you can find the clojure code &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/advent2020/blob/main/src/day10.clj&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fun problem today. Looking forward to tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Teacher looks at Advent of Code 2020 - Days 7 and 8</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day0708/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2020 14:47:17 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day0708/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Today we&amp;#39;ll talk about days &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/7&#34;&gt;seven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/8&#34;&gt;eight&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s start with 7. I teach all morning on Mondays. I woke up and
worked out and then took a look at the problem in the few minutes
before class. It was certainly harder than days one through six but I
felt it was something I knew I could do based on past experience so I
quickly started to throw something together. I tried to finish it in
the between classes but couldn&amp;#39;t get the right answer to part
one. After class I spent more time debugging. I was pretty certain my
algorithm was right and it turns out it was. The problem was in my
parsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyway, to the problem. Read it over if you haven&amp;#39;t yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you&amp;#39;ve studied data structures and algorithms you&amp;#39;ll recognize that
this problem can be viewed as a graph problem. Bags are nodes in the
graph and edges tell you what bags each bag can contain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The data is set up to represent a graph like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img width=&#34;50%&#34; src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/advent2020-0708/g1.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I left out the weights (numbers of bags). This can be represented in
an adjacency list. The video does this in Clojure but in Python, you&amp;#39;d
get something that starts like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;{&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;lightred&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;     : [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;brightwhite&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;mutedyellow&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;],
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;darkorange&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;   : [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;brightwhite&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;mutedyellow&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;],
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;brightwhite&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;  : [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;shinygold&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;],
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;mutedyellow&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;  : [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;shinygold&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;fadedblue&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;],
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;shinygold&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;    :[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;darkolive&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;vibrantplum&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;],
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;darkolive&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;    :[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;fadedblue&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;dottedblack&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;],
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;vibtrantplum&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; :[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;fadedblue&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;dottedblack&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;]}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The challenge comes when you see that many starting points can lead to
the goal of the shiny gold bag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The insight comes when you notice that you can &amp;#34;reverse the edges.&amp;#34;
For example, when we saw the line that led to the lightred contains
brightwhite and mutedyellow, instead we represent it the other way
making two entries - brightwhite is contained by lightred and also
mutedyellow is contained by lightred. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Once we set this up the solution is a breadth or depth first search. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The video doesn&amp;#39;t do a complet walk through but goes into more
details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I like this type of problem for classes because students can see that
sometimes changing the data can make the problem much easier. If you
implement the adjacency list as it&amp;#39;s presented the problem seems
hard. Once you see you can go from shinygold out instead of from  all
the bags to shinygold the porblem becomes much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The other interesting point is that without fundamental data
structures and algorithms this is a hard problem. With them, it&amp;#39;s
pretty straightforward. Remind your students of this when they ask why
they need data structures and algorithms. This problem might be made
up but graphs represent a lot of things in the real world and graph
traversals and algorithms can solve a lot of real world problems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now to day 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Day 8 involved a simple machine simulator and leads to a very
straightforward solution - write a program that simulates the computer
stated in the problem. My solution tries to approach the problem in a
functional way and also makes use of a function lookup table to avoid
multiple ifs. The solution and complete walk through is in the video
and in Clojure but a similar solution can be written in Python.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Teacher looks at Advent of Code 2020 - Day 06</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day06/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 06 Dec 2020 10:14:03 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day06/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/6&#34;&gt;Day 6&lt;/a&gt; turned out to be pretty straightforward. Like day 4 you had to
deal with two consecutive newlines when parsing the data but assuming
you did day 4 that&amp;#39;s no problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The gist is that a group is formed by consecutive lines and groups are
separated by a blank line. Each line in each group is a string of
letters representing answers to questions. For instance, for this
group: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;example&#34;&gt;
abc
abd
ab
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
you have three people. The first answered &amp;#39;yes&amp;#39; to a, b, and c. the
second to a,b, and d and the third to a and b. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Your goal was to figure out how many different questions did each
group answer &amp;#39;yes&amp;#39; to and what was the total across the groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It seemed that the easiest thing to do was to take each group, remove
the newlines and then count the unique characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In Python, something like this (Clojure in the video and on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/advent2020/blob/main/src/day06.clj&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;d&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;abc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;abd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;ab&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;d &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; d&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;replace(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;s &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; set(d)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ans &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; len(s)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, you just have to do that for each group and add them all up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part 2 added a small twist. Now you wanted to look at each group and
count the number of answers that everyone in that group answered &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34;
to. For the above example, it would be 2 - everyone answered a and b.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Assuming your language supports set operations, you can just use
union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Again in Python: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;d &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;abc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;abd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;ab&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;d_list &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; d&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;split()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;result &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; set(d_list[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;])
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; item &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; d_list[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;:]:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    result &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; result &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; set(item)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;print(result)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Again,  do it for all the groups and add it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a great question to go over set operations!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Check out the Clojure video for that approach where I also talk about
easier ways to complete yesterday&amp;#39;s problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A teacher looks at Advent of Code 2020 - Day 5</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day05/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 05 Dec 2020 11:18:59 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day05/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/5&#34;&gt;Day five&amp;#39;s problem&lt;/a&gt; is a nice one for an early CS class. It can be very
much brute forced but it also touches on some nice concepts and can be
solved pretty elegantly. I&amp;#39;ve embedded a walk through in Clojure at
the end but a Python solution would be pretty similar.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Read the problem over if you haven&amp;#39;t. At it&amp;#39;s core you are taking a boarding
pass representing a coded airplane seat number and you&amp;#39;re converting
it to a known seat (row and column). The encoding scheme uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning&#34;&gt;binary
space partitioning&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/5&#34;&gt;question statement&lt;/a&gt; goes over the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of the first things to notice is that you should separate the pass
into two parts - the row, which consists of the first seven characters
each one being an &lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt; or a &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; and the last three which are the
columns and they are marked with either a &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt; or an &lt;strong&gt;L&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, the sample pass &lt;strong&gt;FBFBBFFRLR&lt;/strong&gt; separates into &lt;strong&gt;FBFBBFF&lt;/strong&gt; for the row
and &lt;strong&gt;RLR&lt;/strong&gt; for the clumn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are 128 rows numbered 0 through 127 so you start with 127 (the
back of the plane) and then depending on if the next character is an
&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt; or a &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; you either subtract out half the range size or you
don&amp;#39;t. If the character is an &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; you don&amp;#39;t since you&amp;#39;re at the back
of the section and the back rows are higher. If it&amp;#39;s a &lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt; you do
since you&amp;#39;re at the front and front rows have lower numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, the first &lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt; says you&amp;#39;re at the front so you subtract &lt;strong&gt;half&lt;/strong&gt; the
range and now you&amp;#39;re looking at 0-63. The next character is a &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; so
you don&amp;#39;t subtract anything but you&amp;#39;ll be next looking at 32 through
63 etc. The question has a full walk through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Looking at the  row string, you have &lt;strong&gt;FBFBBFF&lt;/strong&gt;. If we substitute the
amount we subtract for the letters we get &lt;code&gt;64 0 16 0 0 2 1&lt;/code&gt; or the
place values of a binary number &lt;strong&gt;in reverse&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In my solution, I reversed the string and then converted each &lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;
into a number. A &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; became a 0 and an &lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt; became 2^i where &lt;strong&gt;i&lt;/strong&gt; is the
location (index) in the string. For the sample string, once reversed
to &lt;strong&gt;FFBBFBF&lt;/strong&gt; it gives &lt;code&gt;1 2 0 0 16 0 64&lt;/code&gt;. If we sum those up and
subtract from 127 we get our row number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We basically can do the same thing for the column but there you
subtract from 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part 1 of the question asks you to map the row and column to a final
number by calcualing &lt;code&gt;row*8+col&lt;/code&gt; and then find the highest seat number
from a give list of boarding passes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part 2 requires you look through all the boarding passes to determine
your actual seat - the one seat missing from the data set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Lots of good stuff for a class in this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You&amp;#39;ve got the basic data parsing as usual but I love that this can be
brute forced but by noticing the base 2 nature of the data you can
write up a number of different elegant solutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s a complete solution coded up in Clojure. You can also check all

      <title>A Teacher Looks at Advent of Code 2020 - Day 4</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
One of the nice things about Advent of Code is that it gets me to
explore language features I haven&amp;#39;t used yet. Today&amp;#39;s problem got me
to explore Clojure Spec which is a very cool validation
library. There&amp;#39;s a complete run through of the solution in Clojure in
the video but here I&amp;#39;ll talk about the problem in Python (mostly). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/4&#34;&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; is about validating passports. You start with a text
file consisting of passport information. Each passport is one or more
lines with each line having a bunch of key value pairs. For example,
these two lines represent a passport for someone who&amp;#39;s eye color (ecl)
is gray (gry) and who was born (byr) in 1937:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;example&#34;&gt;
ecl:gry pid:860033327 eyr:2020 hcl:#fffffd
byr:1937 iyr:2017 cid:147 hgt:183cm
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The catch is that one passport can span multiple lines and that
passports are separated by two consecutive newlines in the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A passport has 8 field types with one, Country of Origin (cid) being
optional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For part 1, a valid passport is one that contains all 7 required
fields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The video goes over a Clojure solution which, I think is cleaner but
the idea is the same as the Python I&amp;#39;ll talk about here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Splitting the data into a list of potential passports is easy because
you can split the string on two newlines: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;data &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; open(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;../data/sample04.dat&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;read()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;data&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;split(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\n\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now we have a list of string. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next, we can split each string on whitespace so that each string in
each sublist is a string in the form &lt;strong&gt;k:v&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;data_list &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; []
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; d &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; data:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    data_list&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;append([item &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; item &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; d&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;split()])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, for example, data_list[0] might look like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;example&#34;&gt;
[&amp;#39;ecl:gry&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;pid:860033327&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;eyr:2020&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;hcl:#fffffd&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;byr:1937&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;iyr:2017&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;cid:147&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;hgt:183cm&amp;#39;]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, we can convert each passport into a dictionary: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;data_dicts&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;[]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; d &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; data_list:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    temp &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; { item&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;split(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;]:item&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;split(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;] &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; item &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; d} 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    temp&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;pop(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;cid&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    data_dicts&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;append(temp)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The easiest way I came up with to check if a passport was valid was to
make a set out of a list of required field names, make a set out of
each potential passports field names (they&amp;#39;re dictionary keys) and see
if they&amp;#39;re equal: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;fields &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; set([&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;byr&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;iyr&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;eyr&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;hgt&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;hcl&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;ecl&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;pid&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;])
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;valid_passports &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;  [set(x&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;keys()) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; fields &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; x &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; data_dicts]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think the Clojure code is cleaner but it&amp;#39;s much the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part two added a twist - you now have to not only see if the required
fields are there but you had to make sure they had valid data. For
example, height had to start with a positive integer followed by
either &lt;strong&gt;cm&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;in&lt;/strong&gt;. If it was &lt;strong&gt;cm&lt;/strong&gt;, the number had to be in a certain
range and if it was &lt;strong&gt;in&lt;/strong&gt; it had to be within a different range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This didn&amp;#39;t sound hard but could get tricky. For each field type you
could write a function that took in the value and returned true or
false depending on its validity - lots of ad hoc code. You could then
loop over all the passports and test to see if all the conditions were
met. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It turns out that Clojure has a really cool library - Clojure Spec
that does just that. You set up validators for each field type and
then one for an entire passport. Here&amp;#39;s the code: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-clojure&#34; data-lang=&#34;clojure&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::byr&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/and&lt;/span&gt; string? &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;(&amp;gt;= (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;u/parse-int&lt;/span&gt; %) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1920&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;(&amp;lt;= (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;u/parse-int&lt;/span&gt; %) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2002&lt;/span&gt;)))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::iyr&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/and&lt;/span&gt; string? &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;(&amp;gt;= (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;u/parse-int&lt;/span&gt; %) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2010&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;(&amp;lt;= (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;u/parse-int&lt;/span&gt; %) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2020&lt;/span&gt;)))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::eyr&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/and&lt;/span&gt; string? &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;(&amp;gt;= (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;u/parse-int&lt;/span&gt; %) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2020&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;(&amp;lt;= (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;u/parse-int&lt;/span&gt; %) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2030&lt;/span&gt;)))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::hgt&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/and&lt;/span&gt; string? hgt-test))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::hcl&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/and&lt;/span&gt; string? &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;(re-find &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;#[0-9a-f]{6}&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; %)))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::ecl&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/and&lt;/span&gt; string? &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;(re-find &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;amb|blu|brn|gry|grn|hzl|oth&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; %)))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::pid&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/and&lt;/span&gt; string? &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;(re-find &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;^[0-9]{9}$&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; % )))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::cid&lt;/span&gt; string?)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::passport&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/keys&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;                   &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;:req&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::byr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::iyr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::eyr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::hgt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::hcl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::ecl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::pid&lt;/span&gt;]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;                   &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;:opt&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::cid&lt;/span&gt;]))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/valid?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::passport&lt;/span&gt; test-passport)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The last line would test to see if &lt;strong&gt;test-passport&lt;/strong&gt; was valid. It&amp;#39;s all
covered in detail in the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Clojure spec wasn&amp;#39;t required for this problem but I&amp;#39;ve been meaning to
play with it for a while and it led to a clean and elegant way of
testing passports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not sure if I&amp;#39;ll get to more posts or even solve more problems - I&amp;#39;m
trying to limit my own screen time over the weekends but we&amp;#39;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you want to check out all the Clojure goodness here it is: Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I thought I&amp;#39;d do a video for today. No particular reason. Mostly why
not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ll talk about day 3&amp;#39;s problem and code up a solution in Clojure. If
you haven&amp;#39;t ever used Clojure, hopefully this will give a bit of the
flavor. This video also serves double duty as being my next Using
Emacs video since it demos Emacs&amp;#39;s Clojure tools. Mostly Cider which
even with a few quirks is the best development environment I&amp;#39;ve ever
used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;ll do any more videos or blog posts on AOC this
year. I hope to but I&amp;#39;m going to have to get to end of semester
obligations soon so you never know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Teacher Looks at Advent of Code 2020 - Day 2</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day02/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Dec 2020 12:27:27 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Day two introduced some staples of staples of not only Advent of Code but
also of programming problems in general. The first is input
parsing. For this problem you get lines of input like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;example&#34;&gt;
1-3 a: abcde
1-3 b: cdefg
2-9 c: cccccccc
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
or in general&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;number_1&lt;/strong&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;number_2&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Letter&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;String&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are a few ways to handle this. One is to brute force it. In
Python maybe something like: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sample_line&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;4-15 f: abcdefg&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sample_list &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; sample_line&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;split()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;numbers&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;sample_list[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;letter&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;sample_list[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;string&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;sample_list[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;number_list &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; numbers&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;split(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;-&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;num1 &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; int(number_list[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;])
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;num2 &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; int(number_list[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;])
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;letter &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; letter[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;print(num1, num2, letter, string)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
or more concisely: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sample_line&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;4-15 f: abcdefg&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(numbers,letter,string) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; sample_line&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;split()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(num1,num2) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; [int(x) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; x &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; numbers&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;split(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;-&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;letter &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; letter[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;print(num1, num2, letter, string)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you&amp;#39;re working in a language like C, tools like &lt;code&gt;scanf&lt;/code&gt; can make
things easier. I generally turn to &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.usejournal.com/regular-expressions-a-complete-beginners-tutorial-c7327b9fd8eb&#34;&gt;Regular Expressions&lt;/a&gt; and if you&amp;#39;re
doing some AOC with your classes this is a great time to introduce
regex. Basically, you set up a pattern with special symbols to
represent things like sequences of digits and then the regex matcher
does the hard work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s the code to &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;white-space:pre;user-select:none;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;white-space:pre;user-select:none;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;white-space:pre;user-select:none;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;white-space:pre;user-select:none;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;white-space:pre;user-select:none;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;white-space:pre;user-select:none;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;white-space:pre;user-select:none;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;white-space:pre;user-select:none;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;parser_expression&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;(\d+)-(\d+) ([a-z]): ([a-z]*)&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;data &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; []
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; line &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; open(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;../data/day02.dat&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;readlines():
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    x &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; re&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;search(parser_expression,line)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    (mini,maxi,letter,password) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; x&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;groups()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    mini &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; int(mini)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    maxi &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; int(maxi)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    data&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;append([mini,maxi,letter,password])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;parser_expression&lt;/code&gt; in line 1 is the regular expression. Each
section in parentheses is a &amp;#34;group&amp;#34; or a pattern that will be
extracted. The &lt;strong&gt;\d&lt;/strong&gt; for instance means a digit and the &lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; adger it
means 1 or more digits so basically that will match any positive
integer. The &lt;strong&gt;[a-z]&lt;/strong&gt; matches a single character and the *after the
final character match means zero or more of them. Once you know
regular expressions, parsing lines like this becomes very easy. The
only thing that made the above code messy at all was that I wanted to
convert the two numbers into integers rather than leave them as
strings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are a couple of things worth thinking about here. First is know
your libraries. If you know regex the parsing is basically all
done. If not, you have a bit of work. On the other hand, you&amp;#39;re
probably not going to ever have to parse input exactly like this again
so it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense writing a super robust set of  parsing
functions tied in with this data specification. That&amp;#39;s the second
thing. Learning what to leave as building blocks and what to write
into libraries of your own. It&amp;#39;s most definitely worth writing a set
of routines that can be reused. Maybe something to parse dates in a
standard format would be an example. On the other hand, it&amp;#39;s also
worth knowing when you probably won&amp;#39;t be able to reuse things or when
generalizing to a library or set of functions you have to spend too
much time on a hundred options to make in general purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, part 1 of the problem itself is nice because there are a lot of
ways to do it. You could loop through the password and count the
number of times a letter occurs: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;count &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;subpassword &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; password[mini&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;,maxi]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; letter &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; subpassword:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; letter &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; what_im_looking_for:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;        count &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; count &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
or with a list comprehension &lt;code&gt;count = [x for x in password if x ==
waht_im_looking_for ]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You could be more general and build a hash table of counts and then
pull what you want: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;frequencies&lt;/span&gt;(word):
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    d&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;{}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; letter &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; word:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;        d&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;setdefault(letter,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;        d[letter]&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;d[letter]&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is admittedly overkill for the problem but one might need this
for part 2. I coded my original solution in Clojure and Clojure has a
function that does this in one shot: &lt;code&gt;frequencies&lt;/code&gt; so I just used that
and pulled the letter I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Once you have the count, it&amp;#39;s simple enough to see if it&amp;#39;s in the
range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part 2 should have been easy but for me it was a lesson in
reading. You had to pull characters from the password at two specific
indices and see if one or the other, but not both were the letter in
question. Basically an xor. The first mistake one could make has to do
with the indexing and the second in using a regular or which students
will be more familiar with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My mistake is that I misread the question as requiring that you have
one instance of the letter within the &lt;strong&gt;range&lt;/strong&gt; from the low index to
the high index not one instance at either of those two points Needless
to say, lots of wasted time and feeling silly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So that&amp;#39;s day 2. The question is very approachable for APCS-A  and I&amp;#39;d
say even CS0 students. The interesting part to teach would be dealing
with the input, regular expressions, and how much to generalize into
utility functions when writing code over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hope to have time to solve and write up more of these but getting to
crunch time in the semester.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Tomorrow, or more practically, tonight at Midnight,  &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ericwastl&#34;&gt;Eric Wastl&lt;/a&gt; will
once again launch the &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com&#34;&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt;. As I&amp;#39;ve written before, it&amp;#39;s a
month long event where each day a new programming problem is
released. The problems range in difficulty and complexity. Some are
very approachable to beginners and some are crazy challenging. I&amp;#39;ve
written a bunch about AOC in past years:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/solve-a-to-solve-b/&#34;&gt;Solve A to Solve B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/aoc-data-structures-hidden-complexity/&#34;&gt;Data structures and Hidden Complexity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/advent-2017-4-6/&#34;&gt;Tools can shape- how we think&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2019-day1/&#34;&gt;2019 day 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2019-day2/&#34;&gt;2019 day 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2019-day3/&#34;&gt;2019 day 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2019-day4/&#34;&gt;2019 day 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2019-day8/&#34;&gt;2019 day 8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2019-day8-part2/&#34;&gt;2019 day 8 addendum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and a few more not listed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you haven&amp;#39;t heard of AOC, at the stroke of midnight (Eastern), a
new problem is released. From there you can read the problem, get the
input and figure out a solution, usually by writing a program. You
then type in your answer and if it&amp;#39;s correct you get part 2 - usually
a creative spin on part one. Usually you&amp;#39;ll write a program to solve
the problems but sometimes you&amp;#39;ll write code just to explore and come
up with an answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even though there&amp;#39;s a leader board and people can set up their own
private leader boards, I describe AOC as an event not as a
competition. I&amp;#39;ve had former students up near the top but a getting
there requires a lot more than just problem solving. First, you have
to be up when the problem is released, then you have to shortcut scan
what the question is asking. Having a library of pre-written utility
routines is a big help as is using a language that has a lot of
interactive scripty functionality like Python. It also assumes that
even if you do all that is needed, that life doesn&amp;#39;t get in the
way. This means that to get to the top of the leader board, like in
most competitions you have to train and prepare to do just that and
training for that doesn&amp;#39;t really translate to the rest of life&amp;#39;s
challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Solving the problems, though, can translate to other challenges you
might face so I look at AOC as an opportunity to explore some
interesting problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve never finished all of them and that&amp;#39;s okay. Here&amp;#39;s my star count
for each of the years. You get one star for each part of each question
so that&amp;#39;s 50 total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;2019&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stars:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;26&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;40&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;23&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;31&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve never gotten more than 40. I typically wake up and read the
question and see if I can solve it either then or over the course of
the day. Sometimes I&amp;#39;ll come back to a problem but usually not. Last
year, many problems were based on earlier ones. I had an issue in one
of those earlier solutions so never completed the later ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Maybe I&amp;#39;ll go back and finish more, maybe I won&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
None of this matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I had fun, learned a lot and as an added bonus, each problem gives me
an opportunity to reflect on how I might teach it or teach concepts
related to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It all starts in a few hours so if you&amp;#39;re already planning on
participating, have a blast. If you haven&amp;#39;t, check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
