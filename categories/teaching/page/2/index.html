        I&#39;ve been teaching in person for about a month now so I thought I&#39;d give a quick update on how it&#39;s going. I&#39;ve written before about my feelings on how Hunter started the semester (TL;DR - I was very displeased) but that&#39;s not the point of this post. As of today, I believe every student has been required to be stabbed at least once and on October 11, all students must be fully vaccinated to be on campus.

        Be ready to call an audible.
This was advice I got during my third year teaching. I had just transferred from Seward Park to Stuy and was being observed for the first time by my former teacher and now supervisor Richie Rothenberg. I forget exactly what the lesson was on - something with coordinate geometry I think. The lesson was okay but it wasn&#39;t going over well with the class.

        Yesterday was my first day of in person teaching since early March 2020. It was,â€¦ interesting.
I was looking forward to actually seeing my students in person but as I mentioned in my last post, i wasn&#39;t comfortable given Hunter&#39;s current COVID policy and Delta.
I&#39;ll be happier come mid October when 100% of students on campus will be vaccinated but at least for now, mask compliance is high. I only had to talk to one student in a hallway to remind him to put his mask back on and the only other non-masked person was a staff member (too far away for me to address) who had it under her nose.

        I was looking over my TRS statement the other day - that&#39;s Teacher&#39;s Retirement System and noticed that next week I&#39;ll be starting my 32nd year teaching. That&#39;s \(2^5\) or 10000 - 5 bits so I guess you can&#39;t call me a two bit teacher.
Two and a half years at Seward, over 20 at Stuy, and the rest at Hunter College. I&#39;ve had a lot of last days before school starts but this year is different.

        I saw a tweet the other day by a CS teacher. They were talking about how much easier it is to teach CS because it&#39;s fun.
They went on about how they get to create cool problems which makes it so much easier to teach than other subjects.
I&#39;ve heard this a lot over the years particularly from teachers who are into gaming - &#34;CS is fun because you can create games.

        My friend Emmanuel lamented over on Facebook on &#34;Learning Styles,&#34; or more specifically on how it&#39;s still given credence. We all chimed in in agreement but not an hour later I saw a Twitter thread where education thought leaders extolled the virtues of Learning Styles all over again. I pointed out that it&#39;s a great example as to why so many teachers scoff at &#34;the research&#34; and &#34;research backed practices.

        A few days ago I was part of a Twitter discussion on assignment deadlines. I noticed a tweet:
Not sure who needs to hear this, but stop taking off points for late assignments. Itâ€™s not helping students learn responsibility, and itâ€™s not making your job easier. Itâ€™s only making your class inequitable. ðŸ’¯
&mdash; Sydney Jensen (@sydneycjensen) September 26, 2020 I disagreed. I wasn&#39;t necessarily against floating or open deadlines without deductions but rather, they made my life more difficult and weren&#39;t in the best interest of my students.

        We used Zoom for remote classes over the summer but at this point, I&#39;ve also used Coding Rooms, Big Blue Button, and Google meet as well. They each have their own strong points and failings but all are limited in terms of sharing multiple cameras and screen components. All will let you share your camera or share your screen and when you share you screen you can either share it all or a single window.
