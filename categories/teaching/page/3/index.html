        Thursday was the first day of the new semester. The big change was that my classes were done remotely but there were also some other differences. Other changes were that I only met one of my two CS classes on Thursday. That&#39;s my CS0. I&#39;m also teaching a recitation for CS1 which only meets once a week. I&#39;ll see those students as well as my CS0 students for a second time on Monday.

        Looking back, what worked and what didn&#39;t?
Overall, things went very well. We were extremely happy with the cohort&#39;s growth and performance and based on feedback received they were happy with the program so far. I&#39;ll also say that while they&#39;re not finished yet, I can honestly say that every one of them would be a boon to any school in the city in need of a CS teacher (but they&#39;re not available since they&#39;re all already teaching CS at their respective schools :-)).

        What so many non-teachers just don&#39;t get is culture and community can be so much more powerful than curriculum. The problem is, culture and community are harder to create, curate, and maintain and the results don&#39;t always show up on standardized tests.
You can&#39;t force community or culture in a classroom but you can try your best to foster it. It&#39;s ultimately up to the class as a whole. It&#39;s like I tell groups who come to events I organize.

        Our summer intensive was supposed to be in person but COVID-19 changed that in a hurry. We had to scramble to redesign and figure out how we were going to run things.
We decided to go with the following:
Zoom for live meetings Slack for chat Git and GitHub
GitHub classroom for assignments GitHub repos for code distribution, class website and resource sharing. GitHub discussions for off hour and long form discussion While Zoom is a great platform it was lacking in a few areas so we also ended up using: Padlet as a collaborative writing space for groups Assorted whiteboarding tools.

        I&#39;ve frequently been asked for curricula. I&#39;ll hear from a school or someone otherwise involved in a school or education and they&#39;ll ask for a course they can drop in and teach.
I explain it doesn&#39;t work that way. A syllabus or curriculum is only so good. A great curriculum with a bad teacher will still be bad but a great teacher can do a lot to salvage a horrible curriculum.

        Teachers always make decisions in their courses - what to leave in, what to leave out. I&#39;ve seen programming and data structure classes where everything is written from scratch and others where a few things are explained and the students just use built in types like the java LinkedList or Arrays.sort() method.
Do too much from scratch and you&#39;ll never finish the curriculum. Do to little and the students won&#39;t really understand what&#39;s going on and walk a path towards being programmers or coders rather than computer scientists.

        Officially, the last course of the summer was &#34;Modern Topics in Computer Science.&#34; The idea was that K12 CS teachers on the one hand need depth beyond the typical terminal high school course, hence data structures and also breadth so that they could create electives, mix teasers in to the regular courses, or help precocious students with independent or semi-independant explorations. If someone was teaching this in a typical fall or spring semester course, they&#39;d probably have a list of topics and spend a couple of weeks on each.

        Our summer intensive was, well, pretty intensive. We met all day every day for a month and knocked out four classes.

The Advanced Certificate program is geared towards teachers who are currently certified in another subject area who wish to earn an additional New York State teaching certificate in Computer Science.
