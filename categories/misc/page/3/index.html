        Teachers and Police   It&#39;s been an ugly few days but perhaps in some ways a hopeful few as people have been making their voices heard like never before in my lifetime. We&#39;ve seen and endless stream of videos of peaceful protest and far too many instances of police officers overstepping their bounds. I keep hearing about violent protesters but those videos seem to be avoiding my feeds as are the videos of law enforcement going after the looters who are a separate group from the protestors.

        I&#39;ve got some CS Ed stuff I want to write but can&#39;t bring myself to writing about it today. I rarely post outside of my wheelhouse - CS, Education and the intersection of the two.
 I don&#39;t really think I&#39;m qualified to say much about the current crisis. The out of control police, racism, class warfare, a failed government not only at the federal level but also in New York city and state but maybe I can share something worthwhile from my narrow experiences.

 Yep - Covid-19.  First things first - we&#39;re all either recovered or well on the way.  I thought I&#39;d write up our experience as it might be useful for others who are going through similar. This disease is weird and seems to affect people differently but three of us followed a similar path.

        USPS is in financial trouble. That&#39;s been pretty well documented recently. Most reasonable people will recognize that the USPS is both an important service and while it receives no taxpayer support would be profitable were it not for the GOP imposing unfair and unrealistic pension funding requirements in 2006.
 Although I&#39;m an ardent supporter of the post office and feel that privatization of such an important intuition would be criminal today I want to talk about some small repercussions of so many things going to email rather than snail mail.

        Yesterday was the start of Passover and like many others we weren&#39;t able to physically gather with friends and family to celebrate. Since the Talmud, unlike the NYC Dept of Education, doesn&#39;t seem to ban Zoom, like many others, we used Zoom to connect with family.
 Tonight we&#39;ll do it again.
 In the meantime, I thought I&#39;d share this small bit of research Natan did a couple of years ago on a traditional part of the seder: A Historically Informed Echad Mi Yodea

I&#39;m one of those that will, as long as supplies allow, bake and cook my way through our shelter in. Today I made Brazilian carrot cake. It&#39;s not quite the same as an American carrot cake as you&#39;ll see from the recipe below.  First, carrot cake rules:

        Happy new year to everyone.
 I&#39;ve been reading some prediction posts this morning on blogs and social media. Big national and world level stuff. I&#39;ve never been much for predictions so I thought I&#39;d share some more local and personal things I&#39;m looking forward to in the coming year.
 First a couple of big ones.  I&#39;m just about to complete my fourth year at Hunter. Time really does fly.

 Why do I mention this?  Because I&#39;ve been hearing way too often from young people who are too quick to deny themselves opportunities and too often these are from students who have come from less advantaged backgrounds.
 It&#39;s Fall and I&#39;ve been making my rounds visiting local schools to talk to seniors about colleges in general and Hunter CS in particular.
