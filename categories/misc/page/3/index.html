        USPS is in financial trouble. That&#39;s been pretty well documented recently. Most reasonable people will recognize that the USPS is both an important service and while it receives no taxpayer support would be profitable were it not for the GOP imposing unfair and unrealistic pension funding requirements in 2006.
 Although I&#39;m an ardent supporter of the post office and feel that privatization of such an important intuition would be criminal today I want to talk about some small repercussions of so many things going to email rather than snail mail.

        Yesterday was the start of Passover and like many others we weren&#39;t able to physically gather with friends and family to celebrate. Since the Talmud, unlike the NYC Dept of Education, doesn&#39;t seem to ban Zoom, like many others, we used Zoom to connect with family.
 Tonight we&#39;ll do it again.
 In the meantime, I thought I&#39;d share this small bit of research Natan did a couple of years ago on a traditional part of the seder: A Historically Informed Echad Mi Yodea

 Not my normal post but these are not normal times. Besides, this isn&#39;t the first recipe I&#39;ve posted.  I&#39;m one of those that will, as long as supplies allow, bake and cook my way through our shelter in. Today I made Brazilian carrot cake. It&#39;s not quite the same as an American carrot cake as you&#39;ll see from the recipe below.  First, carrot cake rules:

 Well, not my original original career plans. When I started on Wall Street I had no idea what the future would bring. For all I knew, I could have been a career professional programmer or even gone over to the business side.

        Happy new year to everyone.
 I&#39;ve been reading some prediction posts this morning on blogs and social media. Big national and world level stuff. I&#39;ve never been much for predictions so I thought I&#39;d share some more local and personal things I&#39;m looking forward to in the coming year.
 First a couple of big ones.  I&#39;m just about to complete my fourth year at Hunter. Time really does fly.

        Or, as Wayne Gretzky said &#34;You miss 100% of the shots you don&#39;t take.&#34;
 Why do I mention this?  Because I&#39;ve been hearing way too often from young people who are too quick to deny themselves opportunities and too often these are from students who have come from less advantaged backgrounds.
 It&#39;s Fall and I&#39;ve been making my rounds visiting local schools to talk to seniors about colleges in general and Hunter CS in particular.

 Codeland had talks and a keynote in a common auditorium, smaller breakout workshops and a couple of small vendor areas.
 I spent most of the morning upstairs in the GitHub lounge so I onl caught part of one morning talk.
