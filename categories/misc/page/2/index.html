    <div class="content post-summary">
        A big difficulty with creating CS opportunities for all our students is the lack of CS teachers. New York City addressed this problem with their CS4All program - quick form PD to get teachers into CS classrooms in a hurry. One can debate if that was the best way to go but it enabled NYC to create a whole lot of CS classes in a very short period of time.

        I&#39;ve been up in Providence RI since this past Wednesday for SIGCSE2022. The big Computer Science Educators conference. Also, my first in person conference since pre-covid.
 I wasn&#39;t sure how I was going to feel about this big in person gathering but as it&#39;s turned out, it&#39;s been pretty comfortable.
 So far, I&#39;ve attended two terrific keynotes. One by Barbara Liskov and the other Barbara Ericson, some really interesting sessions and some less interesting ones and have had a great time discussing CS education.

        Tomorrow I&#39;ll be driving up to Providence Rhode Island for SIGSE 2022, basically the largest computer science education conference out there. I guess ITSE, a conference I&#39;ve never attended, is larger but that&#39;s really EdTech with some CS.
 The last in person conference I went to was two almost exactly two years ago - also SIGCSE. I arrived in Portland and went to a pre-conference session and on the morning of the big start, about three hours before I ran my session, I saw an email saying we were canceled.

        I used to do the New York Times Crossword puzzle. I don&#39;t remember when I started - some time late in Eugene Maleska&#39;s tenure as the editor. I continued on a few years into Will Shortz&#39;s puzzles. I stopped when the Times wanted to charge me for both print and online. I preferred reading the physical paper but liked printing the puzzle from their online site. I was also pissed at the Times coverage of a number of issues at the time.

        Devorah and I just got off a Zoom pension consultation. Very enlightening.
 I&#39;m 54 so regardless, can&#39;t retire for another year but Devorah hit 55 last November and the DOE can really kill ones spirit and grind you down.
 Overall I&#39;ve been pretty happy at Hunter but I&#39;ve written before about the fact that I&#39;ve been feeling some burn out and have been basically doing 2+ full time jobs myself at Hunter for the past few years and that&#39;s just not sustainable.

        So, tomorrow, October 19, is my birthday. The big 5 4. Okay, maybe it&#39;s not a traditionally big one. It doesn&#39;t end in a zero or a five but I think it rates.
 Why? Because it&#39;s one shy of 55.
 That&#39;s the magic age when I can retire collect my pension should I choose to do so. It&#39;s what you get when start young and put in over 30 years of service.

 I&#39;m a big fan of the CSTA conference. Jake and team have done an amazing job growing the conference and it&#39;s been a highlight of my year every time I&#39;ve attended.
 I could say that I&#39;m not attending due to my schedule - I&#39;m pretty much spending all day every day during July teaching in my CS Teacher Certification program and at the end of the day I&#39;m wiped.

 Yesterday the media outlets called the election for Biden/Harris. It&#39;s not over but I thought this would be as good a time as any to share some thoughts and more importantly concerns.

        In the 10 plus years of this blog I&#39;ve never done a post on my birthday. Okay, maybe I&#39;ve written one on my birthday but never talked about it.
 Why this year?
 No particular reason. Maybe because I&#39;m getting older. I&#39;m 53 today. Devorah will turn 54 in a month - from there one year until she can retire. I can follow a year later. I&#39;m pretty happy with what I&#39;m doing but it&#39;s nice to know that in two years I&#39;ll have a lot of options on the table.

 Other than a couple of small escapes in the last two weeks we&#39;ve been home and working from home in our Manhattan apartment since this all started. Early on we didn&#39;t get out much and we still aren&#39;t and that does take its toll.
