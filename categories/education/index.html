        Following up on my last post.  Soon after I read that tweet, I read Julia&#39;s post on hash tables. This got me thinking more about what is and isn&#39;t taught in school. Hash tables were always taught in CS programs but back in the day you might not have used them much after your data structures or algorithms classes. Nowadays you&#39;re much more likely to use them as they&#39;re built in to so many platforms.

        I saw this tweet by Julia Evans the other day. if you&#39;ve been working in computing for &gt; 15 years -- are there fundamentals that you learned &quot;on the job&quot; 15 years ago that you think most people aren&#39;t learning on the job today?
(I&#39;m thinking about how for example nobody has ever paid me to write C code)

        Well, we just delivered the last formal piece of instruction for the summer intensive. Writing this post between visits to breakout rooms as the cohort works on their final projects.  Tomorrow and Thursday will be presentation time. Each group will give spend thirty minutes teaching us all about some topic in CS along with the plan for how we could teach the topic to our kids. We&#39;ve got a few more things to talk about as a group but it&#39;s mostly time to sit back and enjoy the show.

        Time for some thoughts after week 2.  Since this is the inaugural edition of our program and there was no way to really know what the cohort would be like we&#39;ve been adjusting on the fly. This was expected but we&#39;re finally starting to settle in. We&#39;re still finding more zoom heavy days but as we move towards the end of our data structures segment there should be fewer of those.

        Time for an update on our NY State Teacher Certification Program.  We kicked off on Monday. Twenty two students working with three instructors from 9:00 - 3:00 every day. We&#39;ve been using a combination of synchronous with Zoom and async using Slack and GitHub discussions. We&#39;re using GitHub as our main platform.  Day 0 was very Zoom heavy but we&#39;re trying to balance one big Zoom session a day combined with other work so as to minimize fatigue.

        As many of you know, the CS Education programs I designed here at Hunter were finally approved by NY State late last year. We&#39;re planning to get started this summer. I&#39;ve received many questions about the program and will write up the details here sooner or later but one question I frequently get is &#34;will it be offered online?&#34; This is also something I&#39;ve been asked more than once internal to Hunter.

        The theme of this year&#39;s To Code and Beyond was Computational Thinking. Mark Guzdial gave the keynote. While the talk isn&#39;t currently online, check out this talk that Mark gave last March. It&#39;s not the same but the second halves are and well worth a look.  In the first half, Mark talked about other types of &#34;thinking.&#34; Scientific thinking, engineering thinking and even historical thinking. All had a good amount of overlap with both each other and with computational thinking even as we haven&#39;t yet settled on what computational thinking actually is.

        Today was the fifth &#34;To Code and Beyond&#34; - a one day conference hosted at Cornell Technion and once again Diane Levitt put together a great show. The theme was Computational Thinking and the day consisted of a variety of talks, panels, and activities. I plan on writing about one panel in particular but for today I wanted to address something that came up as a question. One attendee asked a panel about the achievement gap - the fact that when the CS movement got started in NY some of the more innovative and interesting work was being done with some of our most vulnerable students.

        I&#39;ve never been much of a New Years person.
