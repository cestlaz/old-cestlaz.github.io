    <div class="content post-summary">
        There have been a lot of bad ideas foisted onto educators over the course of my career. One of the ones that always pissed me off was the use of a rubric for teacher observation. Specifically, using the Danielson Framework.  The Danielson Framework is a LONG laundry list of topics and concepts and for each a teacher could be rated ineffective, developing, effective, or highly effective.
 It&#39;s garbage.

        Another recent discussion online asked &#34;do you need to know assembly language to be a computer scientist?&#34;
 Sides quickly formed. On one side, it was a strict requirement. Some going so far as saying you had to start with it or at worst a language like C. On the other side you had people claiming that it&#39;s wholly unnecessary for most CS graduates like many of the classes we require of a CS major (I&#39;m looking at you Calc II and beyond).

        I always enjoy Fred Wilson&#39;s predictions for the new year over on his blog and this year was no exception.
 I was inspired to think a bit on his education prediction:
 K12 systems around the US (and around the world) faced with teacher shortages and desperate to erase several years of learning shortfalls, will increasingly adopt online learning services in the school building in lieu of and in addition to in-class learning.

        Following up on my last post.
 Soon after I read that tweet, I read Julia&#39;s post on hash tables. This got me thinking more about what is and isn&#39;t taught in school. Hash tables were always taught in CS programs but back in the day you might not have used them much after your data structures or algorithms classes. Nowadays you&#39;re much more likely to use them as they&#39;re built in to so many platforms.

if you&#39;ve been working in computing for &gt; 15 years -- are there fundamentals that you learned &quot;on the job&quot; 15 years ago that you think most people aren&#39;t learning on the job today?

 Tomorrow and Thursday will be presentation time. Each group will give spend thirty minutes teaching us all about some topic in CS along with the plan for how we could teach the topic to our kids. We&#39;ve got a few more things to talk about as a group but it&#39;s mostly time to sit back and enjoy the show.

        Time for some thoughts after week 2.
 Since this is the inaugural edition of our program and there was no way to really know what the cohort would be like we&#39;ve been adjusting on the fly. This was expected but we&#39;re finally starting to settle in. We&#39;re still finding more zoom heavy days but as we move towards the end of our data structures segment there should be fewer of those.

        Time for an update on our NY State Teacher Certification Program.  We kicked off on Monday. Twenty two students working with three instructors from 9:00 - 3:00 every day. We&#39;ve been using a combination of synchronous with Zoom and async using Slack and GitHub discussions. We&#39;re using GitHub as our main platform.
 Day 0 was very Zoom heavy but we&#39;re trying to balance one big Zoom session a day combined with other work so as to minimize fatigue.
