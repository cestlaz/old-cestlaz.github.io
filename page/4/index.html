        I know, where&#39;s day 9? Thursdays (and Mondays) are already tight for me - I teach all morning and it&#39;s been a rough week. I just had very little energy and focus all day yesterday. I snuck some time in to finish part 1 but couldn&#39;t focus on part 2.
 Today, however, my body gave me an extra half hour of sleep (til 4:30am) so I had extra time and energy.

        Day 8 took a lot longer than the other days. Not all that much code and not too complex, at least after getting through a scary sounding lead up but going from problem statement to solution took both time and thought.
 As I started to read the problem, I wasn&#39;t sure I&#39;d finish it let alone have time to write it up.
 Take a minute to read over the problem.

        Today&#39;s problem was similar to yesterday&#39;s in that it&#39;s ease or difficulty really depended on how you looked at the question.
 For yesterday, the problem was hard if you approached it by modeling each and every lanternfish but it was much easier if you modeled the 8 days of the reproduction cycle. Sure, there was still work to be done but looking at the problem the right way made things much easier.

        Today we had to model the growth of the lanternfish population (problem here).
 Lanternfish spawn new lanternfish every seven days. The trick is that the original starting population consists of fish at different points in the cycle. For instance, if your input data was 3,2,4 then each fish would spawn a new fish in three, two, and four days respectively. The new fish would set their timers to 8 and start counting down to their spawn date on the next day and the original fish would reset it&#39;s timer to 6.

 There are always some kids in class that all too often try to write the fanciest solutions.

int l(char *s){return !*s?0:(l(++s)+1);}   instead of something like:
int string_length(char *s){ int i = 0; while (s[i] != 0){ i=i+1; } return i; }   to calculate the length of a string.

        While my last post was well received, I did have a few conversations where people asked why I did this with such a seemingly minor ethical issue. They wondered that with issues the Facebook algorithm, bail and sentencing algorithms, gerrymandering and other issues dominating the ethical conversation, why focus this topic around something that seems to affect far fewer people and might not even be such a big deal. After all, when it does come up, flight crews can probably ask a few people to shuffle seats and voila, problem solved.

        I&#39;ve held off on sharing any details on my Ethics in CS class because I wanted to wait until some of it ran. I didn&#39;t want to talk about a topic and then find out that after we covered it I was all wrong.
 Now that we&#39;re well into the semester, I think it&#39;s time to share a few things.
 One of my premises when I designed the course was that most ethics courses are taken by either people who already have religion or people who see it as the &#34;easy course&#34; without programming.

        In today&#39;s video, we&#39;ll take a look at a few new completion frameworks for Emacs. For years I&#39;ve been using Ivy and have been very happy with it but since I decided to rebuild my Emacs config from scratch I thought I&#39;d try the new kids on the block, Selectrum and Vertico along with some support packages.
 I&#39;ve liked Ivy from day one and still do. To be honest, from a day to day point of view, I didn&#39;t notice much difference between Ivy and the newcomers but I do like their philosophies - they&#39;re supposed to be simple and minimalist and focus on the Emacs completion API without extending it.
