    <div class="content post-summary">
        div.center {text-align:center;}   The other day codehs made an announcement about their new autograder. Fellow CS Teaching veteran Alfred Thompson had his say up on his blog where he talked about Mark Guzdial's comment on autograders leading to less creative assignments.  I very much agree that autograders, due to their rigidness lend themselves to less creative projects, but thought I'd write up a few of my own thoughts on autograders.

        I won't be teaching my regular classes tomorrow. I'll be meeting all my kids but classes will only be 12 minutes long.  So, how will my colleagues and I spend the rest of the day?  Proctoring the PSAT.  This has always been a sore point with me. Back in the day, many schools, Stuy included, offered the PSAT on the weekend. If you wanted to proctor, you'd come in and get paid a little extra.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        Some of you might have noticed that a few months ago, I decided to affiliate myself with The New York Code and Design Academy or NYCDA. I took on the role of "Academic Director, Youth Programs." It's a part time gig, at least for now and I'm helping them develop their programs for middle and high school students.  Why did I choose them?  There are a number of coding schools with varying levels of hype around them.

You can find them here: Part 1 Part 2   They're both well worth a read.  It got me thinking about how I got my start.  I never planned on being a teacher. I figured I'd just work in tech.

        div.center {text-align:center;}   Funny story from yesterday.  Devorah, my better half, is an assistant principal at another high school. Yesterday evening, she was at work late for "curriculum night." Parents came to the school after hours to hear a variety of presentations.  During her presentation, Devorah mentioned her name, that she had two former public school kids in college, and that's about it for the personal info.

Soon they'll settle on teams and projects and we'll be off for a semester of exploring CS and tech.  The next couple of weeks will be a little chaotic with groups shifting, mentors figuring out which groups to work with and us, the instructors launching each team on its way.

Recently, there's been a kerfufle over what was to be NYGASP's production of Mikado.  My son, Natan wrote a terrific blog post on it and the suspension of belief in opera.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        div.center {text-align:center;}    Earlier this week, Mayor Bill deBlasio announced some ambitious CS Education Plans for NYC. I posted a response here. Now that a few days past, I thought I'd clear a few things up.  First and foremost, I hope my concerns are unfounded and I hope the plan is a tremendous success.  What's got me bummed is not that I need to see my name in lights given that in many ways I've been a CS Ed trailblazer (although who doesn't like a little ego stroking), rather that in my humble opinion NY has squandered a great opportunity and resource and as a results, kids won't get nearly all they could.

I should be happy.  I'm not.  I feel thoroughly defeated.  As many of you know, I've struggled for years to try to bring CS education to more kids and to train more teachers. You also probably know that over the years, I've become pretty good at this.
