        I always enjoy Fred Wilson&#39;s predictions for the new year over on his blog and this year was no exception.
I was inspired to think a bit on his education prediction:
K12 systems around the US (and around the world) faced with teacher shortages and desperate to erase several years of learning shortfalls, will increasingly adopt online learning services in the school building in lieu of and in addition to in-class learning.

        So, 2021&#39;s gone and 2022 just starting.
In a lot of ways, I don&#39;t really see this as a new year. Maybe after I retire but for me and I&#39;m guessing other working teachers the year really starts in early September.
Still, the calendar changed over so even if it feels like midyear to me, it&#39;s still worth a quick look back.
Obviously, a trying year for all of us so I won&#39;t dwell to much on that.

        No post so far on day 12. I finished part 1 but my code was pretty messy which turned part 2 into a mess. I still have to go back to get that second star so just like day 10, my day 12 write up is on hold.
That said, I really enjoyed [[https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/13 ][today&#39;s]] challenge. Paper foldind. You&#39;re given transparent paper with a bunch of marks on it. You have to fold the paper over horizontal or vertical lines and examine the results.

        I wasn&#39;t particularly motivated to start day 11 but took a look over coffee. A grid of points where on each turn or step the points are modified by some rule. Hey, this sounds familiar - cellular automata like Conway&#39;s Game of Life.
You set up your grid and then on each turn just follow the rules. In a traditional Cellular Automaton like Conway&#39;s Game of Life, on each turn each cell looks at its six neighbors and makes a decision as to its next state based on the neighbors and a rule.

        I know, where&#39;s day 9? Thursdays (and Mondays) are already tight for me - I teach all morning and it&#39;s been a rough week. I just had very little energy and focus all day yesterday. I snuck some time in to finish part 1 but couldn&#39;t focus on part 2.
Today, however, my body gave me an extra half hour of sleep (til 4:30am) so I had extra time and energy.

        Day 8 took a lot longer than the other days. Not all that much code and not too complex, at least after getting through a scary sounding lead up but going from problem statement to solution took both time and thought.
As I started to read the problem, I wasn&#39;t sure I&#39;d finish it let alone have time to write it up.
Take a minute to read over the problem.

        Today&#39;s problem was similar to yesterday&#39;s in that it&#39;s ease or difficulty really depended on how you looked at the question.
For yesterday, the problem was hard if you approached it by modeling each and every lanternfish but it was much easier if you modeled the 8 days of the reproduction cycle. Sure, there was still work to be done but looking at the problem the right way made things much easier.

        Today we had to model the growth of the lanternfish population (problem here).
Lanternfish spawn new lanternfish every seven days. The trick is that the original starting population consists of fish at different points in the cycle. For instance, if your input data was 3,2,4 then each fish would spawn a new fish in three, two, and four days respectively. The new fish would set their timers to 8 and start counting down to their spawn date on the next day and the original fish would reset it&#39;s timer to 6.
