        Beautiful weather today, just like yesterday. Forgot to mention yesterday that Clarence Birdseye started his quick freezing experiments in Brockport.
Let's start with the requisite canal pics:

And a picture of my trusty steed:

We originally figured we'd get lunch at Rochester -- about 18 miles into the ride. If we felt good, we'd try to push on to Pittsford. We were pretty excited when we saw:

        Day 3. From Lockport to Brockport.
Lockport is "famous" for it's locks -- the two channel 5 step ones. Brockport is famous for it's... brocks?
After a reasonable nights sleep and breakfast at Hambleton House, our BnB, we were off.

&nbsp;Here's one of the many lift bridges that cross the canal. Right now it's down. It's raised when a boat has to pass under. Back in the day, as there was much less road traffic, the bridges stayed in the raised position so boats and barges could pass.

        Surpassing our day 1 total of 1 mile wasn't going to be hard. We set out for breakfast. Rode down by the Niagara River and over the Rainbow Bridge. I was a little surprised not to find Asgard on the other side.
Back in New York, we continued on. Our first stretch was on Bike Route 5:

Paved but cragly and full of holes. Not very scenic either, at least not until we got closer to Tonowanda where we found the Seabee's memorial:

        Yesterday we started on a 12 day adventure. From Niagara Falls, Ont to Albany, mostly along the Erie Canal Tow path all by bike. A little more ambitious than our four day excursion outside of Pittsburgh last year.
Bright and early we set out -- at Penn Station by 6:00am. That's where we had our first scare -- the Amtrak agent said we couldn't bring out bikes. Amtrak policy say's otherwise (folding bikes that fold to within a certain size are allowed at any time according to their on line regulations.

        I made chapati the other day. Based on a couple of recipe requests and the fact that this blog has been dormant for a while, I thought I'd post the recipe here.
&nbsp;To start -- Chapati is an Indian flatbread. I guess what I made is technically Pulka but it's really easy to make and quite tasty.
Ingredients:
2 cups whole wheat flour1 cup water1 tsp saltMix all the ingredients together to form a dough.

        Sorting from the top and from the bottom I've been meaning to write this post for a couple of weeks, but some times life just gets in the way. I've always thought it important to arm students with as many different tools with which to attack problems as possible. As such, the courses I teach use a number of different languages, each highlighting a different paradigm and thought process. The hope is that by the end of the sequence, they can look at problems from many different angles.
