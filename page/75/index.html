Yesterday there was a Twitter Conversation led by a "national panel of thought leaders in the field." Click on the link.

        I&rsquo;ve never been a huge fan of the way we do varsity sports, and I say this as a guy that coached for a number of years. In NYC, we&rsquo;re governed by the Public School Athletic League or PSAL. Practice time and lack of facilities make teaching difficult, but my biggest problem is the fact that most teams cut, that is, if you&rsquo;re not in the top &ldquo;n,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re out. So, if our basketball team has, let&rsquo;s say 15 kids on it, they get exclusive use of the gym every afternoon during basketball season and no one else can receive coaching or be part of the team.

        The day before Thanksgiving is always fun. For as long as I can remember, recent graduates descend upon Stuy. For the most part, they mull around the senior bar but we get our share up in 301.
This year was a little quiet but I got to see more than my share of graduates over the weekend as I attended the 2002 and 2007 class reunions. I&rsquo;ve only been invited to a handful of reunions and really consider it an honor when I am.

        On going back to work today Since school was still out due to Sandy, we ran a second online class yesterday. At the end of the session, which I&rsquo;ll summarize below, I told the class what I wanted them to accomplish today and over the weekend. One student queried &ldquo;you mean no class on Friday :-(?&rdquo; Alas no &ndash; while students aren&rsquo;t reporting to school this morning, teachers are.
Of course the logic as to why is far from sound.

It's teacher appreciation week -- one of our lesser celebrated weeks. I'm waiting for the annual letter we get from the chancellor. Given the level of teacher bashing over the last few years, I've recently found their emails amusing.
I though I'd take the time to thank a few of my most influential teachers. To paraphrase: whatever good I've been able to do, it has been because I have stood on the shoulders of giants.

        <!DOCTYPE html> Anyone can cook - Chef Gusteau
These days the rage seems anyone can code.
On line attempts to teach coding and computing abound.
We've got Udacity and Coursera trying to bring college level academic offerings to the masses on one extreme and more down to earth "learn to code" efforts with Codecademy getting the most press.
While I applaud any effort to make knowledge more accessible, there are a lot of unanswered questions as to the effectiveness of these latest attempts.
