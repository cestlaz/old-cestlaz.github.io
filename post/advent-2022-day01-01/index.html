It&#39;s <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> season again. Every day a new two part programming
challenge and once again I&#39;m taking part. At least until grading and
other end of term obligations end up eating my lunch.</p>
<p>
I wasn&#39;t planning on writing anything up but the first two days looked
like nice problems for CS1 or even CS0 students and since my friend
Steve was <a href="https://github.com/scerruti/AoC2022">writing up</a> his take, I thought I&#39;d at least comment on the
first two.</p>
<p>
I also recorded a code through in Clojure which you can find at the
bottom of this post.</p>
<p>
Even though I&#39;m using Clojure, a similar approach can be taken in
languages like Python or Javascript. If you enjoy this type of
analysis please read Steve&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/scerruti/AoC2022">posts</a>. His approach is usually different
from mine as he&#39;s working in Java and so is more OOP centric. I love
it when you can think about problems in different ways.</p>

Day 1 - Calorie Counting
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Problem link: <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1"><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1">https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1</a></a></p>
<p>
Here the input was lines of numbers with an extra blank linke
separating sets of inputs:</p>
<pre class="example">
1000
2000
3000

4000

5000
6000

7000
8000
9000

10000
</pre>
<p>
Here, the first three numbers (1000,2000,3000) represent what the
first elf is carrying, 4000 the second elf, 5000, and 6000 the third,
etc..</p>
<p>
The challenge was to figure out which elf carried the most.</p>
<p>
A first year student might read a line at a time building a
sum. Whenever you see a blank line, see if that&#39;s your largest sum so farand
if so, make a not of it.</p>
<p>
In Python:</p>
<div class="src src-text">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sum = 0
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>bigsum  = 0
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>for line in open(&#34;../data/day01.dat&#34;).readlines():
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    if line == &#34;\n&#34;:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        if sum &gt; bigsum:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>            bigsum = sum
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        sum = 0
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        continue
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    sum = sum + int(line)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(bigsum)</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
Another approach, the one I used, was to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Convert the input lines into a list by splitting on double newlines</li>
<li>Convert each list item into a list of numbers</li>
<li>Sum each list</li>
<li>Find the largest</li>
</ol>
<p>The video below shows this in Clojure, but in Python it might look
like this:   </p>
<div class="src src-text">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span style="display:flex;"><span>input = open(&#34;../data/day01.dat&#34;).read().strip().split(&#34;\n\n&#34;)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>input = [x.split(&#34;\n&#34;) for x in input]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>int_input = [ [int(x) for x in sublist] for sublist in input]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>sums = [ sum(x) for x in int_input]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>max(sums)</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
The nice thing here from the teaching point of view is that these
represent two very different approaches and there are probably more.</p>
<p>
For part 2 you just had to add up the three largest elf loads. If you
used the second approach, instead of finding the largest number, you
can just sort the list and add up the biggest three.</p>
<p>
The code for all of this in Clojure can be found <a href="https://github.com/zamansky/advent2022/blob/main/src/day01.clj">here</a>.</p>

Day 2 - Rock Paper Scissors
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Day 2 was a rock paper scissors problem. Input was a list of &#34;moves:&#34;</p>
<pre class="example">
A Y
B X
C Z
</pre>
<p>
The above says that in move 1, your opponent played &#34;A&#34; and you played
&#34;Y,&#34; in move two, your opponent &#34;B&#34; and you &#34;X,&#34; etc.</p>
<p>
The moves meant:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Opponent Letter</th>
<th>Your letter</th>
<th>Means</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>A</td>
<td>X</td>
<td>Rock</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>B</td>
<td>Y</td>
<td>Paper</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C</td>
<td>Z</td>
<td>Scissors</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
Each turned was scored as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Result</th>
<th class="align-right">Points</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>You win</td>
<td class="align-right">6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>You tie</td>
<td class="align-right">3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>You lose</td>
<td class="align-right">0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
Your score for a turn was the results points plus a 1 if you played
Rock, 2 if you played Paper, and 3 if you played Scissors.</p>
<p>
The part 1 solution had you tracing through a game and figuring out
the score.</p>
<p>
What&#39;s nice about this problem is that it can be solved by a very raw
beginner with a not too long set of if statements.</p>
<p>
You can also, however, look at more interesting approaches. </p>
<p>
First, a student might notice that the moves are &#34;in order&#34; in that
each letter, or move, loses to the one after it. That is, Rock loses
to Paper, Paper loses to scissors, and wrapping around, scissors loses
to rock.</p>
<p>
Then, they might see that they can assign a numeric value to each
move:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Opponent Letter</th>
<th>Your letter</th>
<th>Means</th>
<th class="align-right">value</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>A</td>
<td>X</td>
<td>Rock</td>
<td class="align-right">0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>B</td>
<td>Y</td>
<td>Paper</td>
<td class="align-right">1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C</td>
<td>Z</td>
<td>Scissors</td>
<td class="align-right">2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
Finally, they might notice that if they find the difference between
your move and your opponent&#39;s move, you&#39;ll get:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th class="align-right">Difference</th>
<th>result</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="align-right">0</td>
<td>tie - same move</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="align-right">1</td>
<td>You win - you&#39;re the &#34;next&#34; move</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="align-right">2</td>
<td>You lose</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
You can also either deal with mod to wrap around or you can put in a
couple of negative values for the difference on your chart.</p>
<p>
For part 1, my solution basically did what I just described. Make a
look up table to map the letters to values, find the difference, then
look up the points awarded from another look up table.</p>
<p>
The Clojure code can be found <a href="https://github.com/zamansky/advent2022/blob/main/src/day02.clj">here</a> and the video is embedded below.</p>
<p>
For part 2, things were a bit tricker but also more interesting. Now,
your &#34;move&#34; of X,Y, or Z didn&#39;t mean Rock, Paper or Scissors. The
letters now said that depending on your letter you had to select a
move so that you would either win, lose or draw based on this table:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Your letter</td>
<td>Choose a move that results in</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>X</td>
<td>You losing</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Y</td>
<td>A tie</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Z</td>
<td>You win</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
This part was a reduction - look at your letter and figure out what to
replace it with - A, B, or C based on the above chart and then just do
what you did in part 1.</p>
<p>
Here, we notice that we tie if we choose the same move as our
opponent, we win if we choose the &#34;next&#34; move and we loose if we
choose the move that&#39;s two away (mod 3 to deal with the wraparound).</p>
<p>
