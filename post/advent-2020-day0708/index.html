Today we&#39;ll talk about days <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/7">seven</a> and <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/8">eight</a>. </p>
<p>
Let&#39;s start with 7. I teach all morning on Mondays. I woke up and
worked out and then took a look at the problem in the few minutes
before class. It was certainly harder than days one through six but I
felt it was something I knew I could do based on past experience so I
quickly started to throw something together. I tried to finish it in
the between classes but couldn&#39;t get the right answer to part
one. After class I spent more time debugging. I was pretty certain my
algorithm was right and it turns out it was. The problem was in my
parsing.</p>
<p>
Anyway, to the problem. Read it over if you haven&#39;t yet.</p>
<p>
If you&#39;ve studied data structures and algorithms you&#39;ll recognize that
this problem can be viewed as a graph problem. Bags are nodes in the
graph and edges tell you what bags each bag can contain.</p>
<p>
The data is set up to represent a graph like this: </p>
<img width="50%" src="/img/advent2020-0708/g1.png">
<p>
I left out the weights (numbers of bags). This can be represented in
an adjacency list. The video does this in Clojure but in Python, you&#39;d
get something that starts like this:</p>
<p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">{<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;lightred&#39;</span>     : [<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;brightwhite&#39;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;mutedyellow&#39;</span>],
 <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;darkorange&#39;</span>   : [<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;brightwhite&#39;</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;mutedyellow&#39;</span>],
 <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;brightwhite&#39;</span>  : [<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;shinygold&#39;</span>],
 <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;mutedyellow&#39;</span>  : [<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;shinygold&#39;</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;fadedblue&#39;</span>],
 <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;shinygold&#39;</span>    :[<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;darkolive&#39;</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;vibrantplum&#39;</span>],
 <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;darkolive&#39;</span>    :[<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;fadedblue&#39;</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;dottedblack&#39;</span>],
 <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;vibtrantplum&#39;</span> :[<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;fadedblue&#39;</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;dottedblack&#39;</span>]}</code></pre></div></p>
<p>
The challenge comes when you see that many starting points can lead to
the goal of the shiny gold bag. </p>
<p>
The insight comes when you notice that you can &#34;reverse the edges.&#34;
For example, when we saw the line that led to the lightred contains
brightwhite and mutedyellow, instead we represent it the other way
making two entries - brightwhite is contained by lightred and also
mutedyellow is contained by lightred. </p>
<p>
Once we set this up the solution is a breadth or depth first search. </p>
<p>
The video doesn&#39;t do a complet walk through but goes into more
details. </p>
<p>
I like this type of problem for classes because students can see that
sometimes changing the data can make the problem much easier. If you
implement the adjacency list as it&#39;s presented the problem seems
hard. Once you see you can go from shinygold out instead of from  all
the bags to shinygold the porblem becomes much easier.</p>
<p>
The other interesting point is that without fundamental data
structures and algorithms this is a hard problem. With them, it&#39;s
pretty straightforward. Remind your students of this when they ask why
they need data structures and algorithms. This problem might be made
up but graphs represent a lot of things in the real world and graph
traversals and algorithms can solve a lot of real world problems</p>
<p>
Now to day 8. </p>
<p>
Day 8 involved a simple machine simulator and leads to a very
straightforward solution - write a program that simulates the computer
stated in the problem. My solution tries to approach the problem in a
functional way and also makes use of a function lookup table to avoid
multiple ifs. The solution and complete walk through is in the video
and in Clojure but a similar solution can be written in Python.</p>
