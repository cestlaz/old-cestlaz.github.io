There were a few posts over on Facebook this weekend about teacher
certification. It started with a question - should teacher
certification be based on an exam like APCS-A with the teacher
correctly answering 85% or greater. A lively discussion
followed. There was agreement and disagreement with responses ranging
from:</p>
<ul>
<li>good idea</li>
<li>it&#39;s too hard</li>
<li>it&#39;s not hard enough</li>
</ul>
<p>There was also a discussion of the importance of content knowledge vs
knowing how to teach in general.</p>
<p>
Since there was a lot going on in the thread I thought I&#39;d pull my own
thoughts out into this post.</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s first look at the test. There are a number of states that have
a content test for computer science. For some states, I think it&#39;s the
only requirement. In terms of content, at least the Praxis exam is
something like APCS-A on steroids. This is not a good thing. Don&#39;t get
me wrong, I think a qualified CS teacher should know more than APCS-A
on steroids but a single day test is not how you measure deep content
knowledge. I know plenty of students who&#39;ve passed standardized
exams - be they regents, AP, or other but they were no way qualified
to teach the course. They knew the formulas, recognized the patterns,
but didn&#39;t really know the material. Is this what we want of our CS
teachers? I certainly don&#39;t. I&#39;m not hugely opposed to an exam
covering somethign like college CS1 content other than my general
anti-testing beliefs - it would help to curtail some of the problems
that will invariably arise with weak certification programs but it
should no way be the actual bar to teach - if it exists, it should be
just one standard measure along the way.</p>
<p>
Now to that content vs pedagogy thing. What current teachers and in
fact most people in the CS Ed space forget is that states move slowly
and that we&#39;re playing the long game. Right now most CS teachers are
converts from other disciplines and relatively few have strong CS
backgrounds but over time this will change. As CS becomes more
established we&#39;ll have young teachers entering the filed with the
intent of becoming a CS teacher. If states and teacher prep programs
set the content bar low that&#39;ll be what we&#39;re stuck with for a LONG
time.  We wouldn&#39;t dream of creating a science teacher credential
where the teacher hardly knows any science - no way should we do it
for CS or any other subject.</p>
<p>
The truth is that we need teacher prep programs that ensure that new
CS teachers know both the content and how to teach it and that content
should not be tied in to any specific curriculum. I wrote more about
all of this <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teachers-prep-big-pic/">here</a>. </p>
<p>
So what do do with current teachers and current needs? Easy - give
them time. Back when I started teaching I was a career changer. I
never took an education course, never student taught, nothing. Turns
out that Math was a shortage area so I had an option - as long as I
had enough math credits I&#39;d get a temporary license  and start
teaching. Instead of teaching 5 classes, I&#39;d teach 4 and get a
mentor. I then had to get a certain number of education credits within
a certain period of time. Since I already had the subject credits it
was just about learning how to teach. Truth is, I barely survived that
first year but things did get better.</p>
<p>
New York and other states probably couldn&#39;t do the exact same
thing. First off, current and potential teachers might not know the
content so it wouldn&#39;t just be ed courses and second, certification
rules have changed big time since NCLB. Still, they could do something
similar - approve certification programs like the one I created at
Hunter - ones designed for current non-CS teachers and give teachers a
period of time to complete it. For career changers, create CS version
of programs like the NY Teaching Fellows. </p>
<p>
What isn&#39;t acceptable is saying that CS teachers don&#39;t have to know CS
and that career changers who know CS don&#39;t have to learn how to
teach. Create the programs and give people time. We&#39;re playing the
long game and the only way we lose is if we cut corners for
convenience at the expense of the kids.</p>
