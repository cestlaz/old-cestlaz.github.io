As I said at the start of these three posts, I do want to stay in the
game. Maybe take a break and definately slow down but I still think
I&#39;ve got something to contribute.</p>
<p>
I&#39;m writing this so that you can have it in the back of your mind in
case a great match appears either soon or somewhere down the road.</p>
<p>
I think I posses a somewhat unique set of skills and experiences. A
thirty year teacher with a strong CS/Tech background, I&#39;ve taken students
from blank slate to industry, created entire programs, and worked with
educators from early grades through college level.</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve also worked as a software engineer and have remained in touch and
connected with the tech industry.</p>
<p>
What might be appealing?</p>
<p>
Not sure.</p>
<p>
Probably not full time and since I&#39;ll be collecting my pension it&#39;ll
be about fit much more than money. Still, I&#39;d never say never on the
right opportunity.</p>
<p>
I&#39;d love the opportunity to travel more - even if just in the
region. I think that&#39;s my biggest regret is that Devorah and I really
never had the opportunity or took the time to see the country or
world.</p>
<p>
Maybe if a company wants someone as a rep at conferences like all
those Ed Conference sponsors or who knows what else.</p>
<p>
I&#39;d also be open to longer gigs elsewhere - a month, a semester, or
even a year on an interesting project where we can get to know a new
community.</p>
<p>
I know the big tech companies work with colleges to try to help them
do what I did with Daedalus at Hunter. Given that none of them have
people with the range of educational experiences and successes I
have, they could do far worse than engaging me to help with these
programs.</p>
<p>
Maybe some colleges, universities, or governments have a side project
and they could use someone like me.</p>
<p>
To be honest, I don&#39;t know but figured this was a good way to get the
word out.</p>
<p>
So, thanks for reading and keeping me in mind.</p>
<p>
Now, back to our regular blogging program.</p>
