<p>
I noticed a tweet the other day talking about gamification of
education. It got me thinking.</p>
<p>
Gamification isn&#39;t specifically the hot trend right now, at least not
as &#34;the one true way&#34; to teach but every few years it surges as this
great new idea to fix education.</p>
<p>
When it surges, it&#39;s always the hot new thing but it never really is.</p>
<p>
Gamification has been around at least since I was in grade school and
it was never a magic bullet. It might not have been called
gamification but it was there.</p>
<p>
Back in grade school, those stickers you got - gamification. Earn a
pizza party for the class gamification. Even those leveled readers
were gamified. I mean, you literally leveled up.</p>
<p>
I remember early in my career I had to take a number of education
classes and gamifying was a big strategy that the professors all
taught to engage all the students. Contrast that with the advice I got
in schools by pretty much every experienced teacher who took me under
their wings - some kids are motivated by stickers but many
aren&#39;t. It&#39;s a superficial trick and you&#39;ll only get so much mileage
out of it. It&#39;s not the be all and end all.</p>
<p>
Of course, ed tech companies can thrive on gamification because
they&#39;re specifically catering to customers who thrive on it but it&#39;s
not a magic bullet by any means. On the other hand, it can also be low
effort to implement so there are plenty of times when it&#39;s worth a
shot.</p>
<p>
This got me thinking about other teaching techniques that were the new
hot thing but were in fact around back in the day and more often than
not, nothing special.</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s take a look at a few:</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-1">
The Flipped Classroom
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
This is a big one the big way to fix education. Have the kids watch
videos before class and then do other things in class.</p>
<p>
New idea?</p>
<p>
Not so much.</p>
<p>
It&#39;s called homework.</p>
<p>
Homework can be used to review past concepts and also to introduce new
ones.</p>
<p>
So, not a new idea at all but does it work?</p>
<p>
Not really. Sure, anything that moves from college style lecturing to
active learning during class time is good but &#34;flipping the classroom&#34;
has the same issues as homework.</p>
<p>
Not all kids do or understand the homework and if you&#39;re class
activities depend on what&#39;s done the night before, you&#39;re in trouble.</p>
<p>
On top of that, there&#39;s been a recent movement against homework that&#39;s
also been gaining traction an that&#39;s certainly contrary to flipping
the classroom.</p>
<p>
So, flipping the classroom - new? Not so much. Effective? Sometimes
but like anything else, it&#39;s not a magic bullet just a tool that can
be usefully or poorly deployed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-2">
Code Tracing
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Another practice I&#39;ve seen hyped more is Code Tracing. This one&#39;s
easy  - it&#39;s a good practice. It&#39;s not new though. Code tracing - you
write out a table of variable values and you play computer, going
through the code line by line.</p>
<p>
This is actually very similar to how students learned to graph linear
and quadratic equations. Make a table for x, and y, trace through the
algorithm, and chart the results.</p>
<p>
Good practice but not new.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-3">
Subgoal Labeling
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Another good practice that&#39;s cropped up in the past few years. Once
again, not new.</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t call it subgoal labelling but I was writing code that way
back in the 1980s.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-4">
Discovery Learning
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Back when I started teaching, cooperative learning was the true way,
more recently discovery learning took the mantel. Fortunately we&#39;re
swinging back to more generic active learning which can incorporate
discovery learning and other techniques so maybe where actually
getting somewhere.</p>
<p>
The thing about discovery learning is that even when I was a kid, we
were in classes where some of our teachers developed experiential
units where student groups worked at their own pace through activities
that led them through learning a topic - discovery learning.</p>
<p>
Now, this practice can be good but it&#39;s also not &#34;the way.&#34; I read
posts and articles from acclaimed schools and teachers about how they
do everything using discovery learning. Then you look further. They&#39;re
almost always in rich private schools with small classes and almost
unlimited resources. Yeah - try that every day in an overcrowded
under resourced public school.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-5">
Parsons Problems
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Let&#39;s close with one more. Parsons problems - scrambled lines of code </p>
<p>
Like code tracing and subgoal labeling, Parsons Problems appear to be
a useful teaching technique and like the former two, nobody has
claimed them to be the be all and end all - all are just tools in the
tool box for a teacher to use as appropraite.</p>
<p>
Parsons problems though are also not new - they&#39;re a CS take on
scrambled paragraphs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-6">
Final thoughts
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Now, just because these new ideas aren&#39;t new doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re
bad. My big complaint about the ones I don&#39;t like is that they&#39;re
mis-applied as a cure all not that they can&#39;t be effective when used
appropriately.</p>
<p>
The point is that these new ideas that you&#39;ll hear about from your ed
professors or read in the research aren&#39;t necessarily new.</p>
<p>
To be honest, most teachers will get their best tools from their peer
group - fellow teachers, frequently more experienced ones or if
they&#39;re lucky, In service or pre-service instructors who are in fact
experienced K12 teachers who are sharing their practices. This is as
opposed to when those teachers are employed to teach someone elses
canned curriculum.</p>
<p>
In any event, I always get a kick out of seeing a &#34;new&#34; practice and
then thinking about how old it actually is - if you&#39;ve got some to
share, please do.</p>
