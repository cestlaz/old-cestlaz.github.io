 No particular reason. Maybe because I&#39;m getting older. I&#39;m 53 today. Devorah will turn 54 in a month - from there one year until she can retire. I can follow a year later. I&#39;m pretty happy with what I&#39;m doing but it&#39;s nice to know that in two years I&#39;ll have a lot of options on the table." />

In the 10 plus years of this blog I&#39;ve never done a post on my
birthday. Okay, maybe I&#39;ve written one <strong>on</strong> my birthday but never
talked about it.</p>
<p>
Why this year?</p>
<p>
No particular reason. Maybe because I&#39;m getting older. I&#39;m 53
today. Devorah will turn 54 in a month - from there one year until she
can retire. I can follow a year later. I&#39;m pretty happy with what I&#39;m
doing but it&#39;s nice to know that in two years I&#39;ll have a lot of
options on the table. I can stay the course or maybe look for new
challenges. By then, should things continue apace, my undergraduate
program will have been running and growing for seven years, I&#39;ll have had
three cohorts of teachers go through my advanced certificate program
and I should even have my first Masters in CS Education graduates. </p>
<p>
For today, it&#39;s mostly business as usual. Plan is to head out for my
morning run, come back and teach class. </p>
<p>
After that, I&#39;ll head down to Varick Street to drop off my ballot. </p>
<p>
As to the rest of the day, we&#39;ll see. I&#39;ll probably spend most of it
trying to set up virtual school visits.  Looking forward to the family
dinner - Natan&#39;s cooking tonight as he does often so I know it&#39;ll be
tasty.</p>
