Just finished entering grades closing out my 32nd year teaching.</p>
<p>
Whew!</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been a hard year for me and I&#39;m sure even harder for the K12
teachers out there. Still this year I&#39;m really missing what I was oh
so many years ago - a regular teacher.</p>
<p>
Teaching from September through June is a beast and from my first day
on the job I had to work ten times harder than I ever had to as a
software engineer and was commensurately exhausted. In spite of what
the &#34;real world&#34; says teachers need their summers to recharge the
batteries. This isn&#39;t to say that teachers don&#39;t work over the
summer - they lesson plan, attend PD and in fact a bunch of them will
be with me, working towards their NY State CS teaching certification.</p>
<p>
Now, I&#39;m also technically on a school year contract so why do I wish I
was a regular teacher? Because once you enter those final grades, you
put the past to bed. Once I clicked on &#34;post grades&#34; in CUNYFirst I
thought about that. Early in my career, before I had to deal with
building Stuy&#39;s CS program and otherwise getting involved in the
movement, once those grades were entered I was done. I could mentally
turn off. My responsibilities to student and school were done and I&#39;d
have a couple of months before the next go around. </p>
<p>
I noted that I should have been feeling that but wasn&#39;t. Why not?
Because I&#39;m still immersed in dealing with issues for my advanced
certificate program - working on scholarship issues, getting the
teachers, making sure they&#39;re up to speed, finding instructors under
some draconian restrictions placed on me by both Hunter and the staet,
andto be honest, the self imposed stress of feeling responsible for
making everything work.</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve &#34;just taught&#34; and maybe would like to get
back to that but even then, all this is making me seriously think
about that possible (probable?) retirement in a year to scale things
back or change things up.</p>
<p>
In any event, ploughing ahead with the teacher certification program
this month to get things in order and then teaching through
July. Should get a week or two of downtime in August so that&#39;ll be the
time to reflect on the year in depth. Until then it&#39;s nose to the
grindstone.</p>
