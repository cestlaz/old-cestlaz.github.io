I haven&#39;t been blogging much this year. Not sure why - probably pandemic
fatigue. It&#39;s also affected my blog reading - more scanning, less deep
reading. I&#39;ve also been trying to spend mode time off screen learning
how to paint (with,let&#39;s say  mixed results :-) ) leaving less time
and energy to blog. Hopefully I&#39;ll pick up on both ends as more people
get vaccinated and we can get to a more normal life. </p>
<p>
In any event, I tried a new motivation for Quicksort today so I
thought I&#39;d share.</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve approached teaching the Quicksort in a variety of ways (<a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/post/try-something-new/">here</a>,
<a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/quick-sort-starting/">here</a>, <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2010-03-14-sorting-from-top-and-from-bottom/">here</a>, <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-03-12-select-to-sort/">here</a>) but never had a great lead in activity. Merge sort
was easy in person since you can &#34;Tom Sawyer&#34; <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-02-27-dumbass/">shuffling a deck of
cards</a> in class. We adapted this activity pretty well to <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/post/merge-over-zoom/">work over Zoom</a>
this past summer in our teacher certification program. Quicksort
however, haven&#39;t found a good one. </p>
<p>
Thinking about how to leverage remote, I had an idea to try - use
polls. I use <a href="https://zulip.com/">Zulip</a> for class discussions. It&#39;s like Slack but is open
source, can be self hosted, you can post from email,  and has much
better threading. I wrote a small bot to quickly create emoji
polls. </p>
<p>
First I asked for the students to share their birtdays - just month
and day in the form MMDD so if you were born on March 12th you would
write 0312 in the chat. </p>
<p>
Then, I picked one birthday at random, let&#39;s say 0515. </p>
<p>
I then created a poll: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>🐶 My birthday is earlier in the year than 0515</p>
<p>
🐱 My birthday is later in the year than 0515</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The bot tags the post with the emoji and the class can click on their
choice. </p>
<p>
We then talk about what we now know - </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We now know the exact location of 0515 with respect to all the
dates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The data set is now partially ordered (everything less than 0515 to
the left, greater to the right).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I also drew out some diagrams showing what was happening </p>
<p>
This is also one iteration of the Quicksort. </p>
<p>
We do this again on one side and continue to discuss. </p>
<p>
From here we finish developing the algorithm and we&#39;re off to the
races.</p>
<p>
As usual, I won&#39;t know for a while how well this worked or if it did
at all but the students seemed to be engaged and so far I think it
helped get a good feel for how the algorithm worked. </p>
<p>
Using Zulip or other chat polls in this case made the motivating
activity easy and seamless. I&#39;m not sure that this particular activity
would be as easy to implement in person unless you used some
technology like clickers. </p>
<p>
We finished off the class discussing how we should test our
implementations. They&#39;re going to test the sorts on a variety of data
sets including sets where all values are the same or are already
sorted. Given our naive pivot selection this should lead to some
pretty bad runtimes – fodder to motivate the next class.</p>
