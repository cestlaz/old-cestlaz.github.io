So it seems like Copilot and similar will be beneficial to programmers
but the question remains as to how beneficial. Will it be incremental
change or will it be a game changer?</p>
<p>
Today we&#39;ll look at how it will affect teaching and learning CS.</p>
<p>
It seems pretty clear that one group of learners will benefit from
things like copilot - people who are already strong programmers who
are learning something new. Like autocomplete on steroids it will free
those programmers of having to look everything up all the time. I
guess a second group that will benefit will be autodidacts but they&#39;ll
thrive no matter what and when we&#39;re talking about opportunity and
equity we&#39;ve got to focus on everyone else.</p>
<p>
For everyone else, particularly those learning in classes using
copilot will have certain benefits but the real question isn&#39;t &#34;is
there an advantage&#34; but rather a costs benefits analysis.</p>
<p>
Since copilot can be thought of as autocomplete on steroids we can
compare the discord that goes on when discussing IDEs with
autocomplete. </p>
<p>
Some teachers think autocomplete is great and don&#39;t see any downside
to students using editors that support it. Others feel that it&#39;s
important for students to type everything out.</p>
<p>
On the one hand, you can have autocomplete for things like
<strong>system.out.writeln</strong> - type <strong>writeln</strong> and hit tab and you&#39;re done. One
could argue that if you&#39;re ever in an environment without autocomplete
you&#39;d be screwed but if you think about it, there&#39;s no deeper
understanding if you type <strong>system.out.writeln</strong> vs <strong>writeln</strong>
particularly for beginners where the system.out is boilerplate.</p>
<p>
On the other hand typing <strong>for</strong> and having that complete to a for loop
is different than actually typing out the complete loop. One could
argue that typing for and then tab is just a higher level of
abstraction but I&#39;d argue that it&#39;s important to understand what&#39;s
going on with the loop first. This is where I&#39;m not sure if the
autocompletion is the right way to go.</p>
<p>
Ideally, I&#39;d love to see students &#34;level up&#34; - after typing out for
loops for a bit they can unlock the for loop autocomplete feature -
hey - now that&#39;s an idea for a student ide!!!</p>
<p>
I know that some people also feel that hand writing things is an aide
to learning. If that&#39;s so, is typing as well? Is writing a for loop by
hand then then typing better? Is typing it all out better than just
drag and dropping a block? I don&#39;t know the answer to any of these but
I think they&#39;re interesting questions.</p>
<p>
The question, or at least one of the questions about using copilot in
teaching and learning is the same but copilot takes it to the next
level. Instead of typing <strong>for</strong> tab and getting a for loop you can type
<strong>// sum the values of an integer array ar</strong> - you can use it to
complete programming <a href="/posts/programming-idioms/">idioms</a> or even complete functions.</p>
<p>
Bigger time concepts but the same basic ideas.</p>
<p>
There is another question that I think is going to get lost in the
shuffle though. Even if we decide that using copilot like technologies
is an absolute win, will there be unintended consequences. Will other
things be lost.</p>
<p>
This has happen time and again.</p>
<p>
In CS, when APCS-A/B went from C++ to Java we lost memory
management. This was good in certain ways but memory management is an
important concept for computer science students to understand. Take it
out of CS1 and CS2 and you have to put it back somewhere else. From
what the people doing the hiring in tech in the years following 5
years after the switch, it wasn&#39;t always put back or put back
effectively. This isn&#39;t a surprise since every college does things
their own way and if a student places out of one or more courses with
AP credit, well, they might miss something critical or be less well
prepared for it when it does appear.</p>
<p>
The other big example I always use is from math. Calculators. No, I&#39;m
not going to say that having students work out hard arithmetic by hand
was a good and important thing. I&#39;m talking about interpolation.</p>
<p>
Prior to calculators, when our students learned about logs or trig
functions they had log and trig tables. The tables only had so many
entries so students had to find values between the entries and they
invariable did have to, they learned and used linear interpolation.</p>
<p>
If you think about it, that might have been the most useful real life
math skill taught in high school math at the time. Certainly it was up
there.</p>
<p>
Hello calculators, goodbye trig and log tables. Goodbye learning
interpolation. That&#39;s a skill that&#39;s been lost to students for now
almost a quarter of a century. Sure, students can and have been
functioning with knowing interpolation but when you look at the math
that has and hasn&#39;t been taught I&#39;m fairly confident in saying that
when we stopped teaching interpolation something was lost.</p>
<p>
That&#39;s my fear of copilot type technologies.</p>
<p>
When we teach mergesort we&#39;re not just teaching mergesort. We&#39;re
teaching the concept of divide and conquer algorithms. We&#39;re
discussing run time. We&#39;re looking at sorting in place or not. We also
have a platform to discuss solving problems that make use of different
but similar algorithms.</p>
<p>
When we solve a dynamic programming problem we&#39;re not solving a
specific problem but we&#39;re teaching a general method of problem
solving.</p>
<p>
At a smaller scale level, when beginners program they make errors. Now
error messages aren&#39;t particularly helpful but learning how to read
them and fix ones errors is yet another manner of problem solving
we&#39;re teaching. Some may argue that error messages will get better in
the future. Well, I&#39;ve been programming for decades and while they&#39;re
a little better than from way back, they&#39;ve got a way to go. Besides
the problem sometimes isnot so much that the error is bad but that
students don&#39;t take the time to read through the (admittedly overly
complex) wall of text. Solving unexpected errors, reading
documentation, searching for solutions. These are all things we&#39;re
teaching beyond just the coding. </p>
<p>
Copilot might make for faster coding but how much of our ability to
teach that more important problem solving will be lost?</p>
<p>
Of course the answer might be none or it might be that the benefits
might outweigh the costs but educators should pay close attention not
to the superficial but very cool way that copilot replaces a short
prompt with a long coded solution but rather to what we&#39;re really
trying to teach our kids beyond grunt coding and how will copilot
affect that.</p>
