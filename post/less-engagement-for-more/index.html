I think many of us are finding student engagement to be one of the
more challenging aspects of remote teaching. I sure am.
</p>
<p>
In person it&#39;s much easier to have in class discussions. You can read
faces and body language, move around the room, encourage cross
discussion and, well, you know, teach in the usual sense. 
</p>
<p>
Much harder on Zoom. 
</p>
<p>
The default behavior isn&#39;t a room of people all together but rather a
bunch of individual teacher student connections. The sense, at least
to me, is that it&#39;s more a whole bunch of simultaneous individual
meetings rather than one big all together group. This makes cross talk
harder.
</p>
<p>
Next we have cameras. I wish I had more kids turn them on. I don&#39;t
force them but it&#39;s really hard talking to a bunch of names and it
really makes it feel like less of a class. When you&#39;ve got a grid
mixed of people and blanks engagement is made even more difficult. Of
course I have no idea as to how engaged or disengaged camera off kids
are. They might be really engaged and involved. It&#39;s just hard to
tell and hard to assess.
</p>
<p>
So, business as usual from an in person class isn&#39;t working - time to
try something new. 
</p>
<p>
Instead of questioning and working to start a discussion in class as
per usual, I&#39;m reworking some questions more into small group prompts
with discussion points and something to report back on, sometimes as a
group directly and sometimes through some shared platform like a
Padlet. So far results are promising. This means a lot of short quick
breakouts throughout the class.
</p>
<p>
The upside is that the students should be more engaged in the small
group discussion. That seems to be the case based on what they&#39;re
reporting back  and what I see when I drop in. 
</p>
<p>
The downsides include the added time as we get in and out of breakout
rooms and while it&#39;s more engagement overall, it&#39;s less engagement
with the teacher and harder for me to use engagement as an
assessment. I know I can drop in on breakout rooms but dropping in
changes the dynamic - it&#39;s very different from lurking in a regular
classroom and observing what&#39;s going on. I also can&#39;t get to all the
breakout rooms as each visit is clunky and takes time - more time than
doing similarly in a live class. On the additional time this takes,
I&#39;m not really concerned about that. Remote takes longer, that&#39;s
life. 
</p>
<p>
Overall, this looks to be a promising approach so I&#39;ll see where it
leads.
</p>
<p>
Since this started I&#39;ve sat in on or read a bunch of remote best
practice and none of them came close to leading me to switching things
up in this way. I came to try this through honest self reflection,
observing how my classes were going and talking to my peers. The truth
is, this might be great for me but doesn&#39;t work for other teachers and
other teachers might not have the engagement challenges at all. 
</p>
<p>
If anything this left me stronger int he belief that best practices
are not best practices at all. They&#39;re practices. It&#39;s up to the
teacher to figure out what&#39;s best for their students and themselves.
