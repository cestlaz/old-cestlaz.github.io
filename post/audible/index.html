Be ready to call an audible.</p>
<p>
This was advice I got during my third year teaching. I had just
transferred from Seward Park to Stuy and was being observed for the
first time by my former teacher and now supervisor Richie
Rothenberg. I forget exactly what the lesson was on - something with
coordinate geometry I think. The lesson was okay but it wasn&#39;t going
over well with the class. I was teaching at too low a level for my
audience. I could feel it as I was teaching but as I was pretty
inexperienced I wasn&#39;t confident in changing things up on the fly.</p>
<p>
Afterwards, Richie and I debriefed. He said the lesson was
satisfactory - the magic word you need on any observation but that it
could have been much better. I had only been teaching at Stuy for a
few weeks and even though I was a Stuy grad I hadn&#39;t had time to get
my head around where the students were at. Richie said that sometimes
you just have to call an audible. For a young teacher, easier said
than done. In addition to not having a great handle on my students yet
I also wasn&#39;t confident in flying without a net. </p>
<p>
This is why it&#39;s so important for teachers to really know their
stuff - both the content and how to teach it. It&#39;s why I&#39;m concerned
when I see so many leaders in CS education pushing scripted curricula
and PD based training to fully &#34;prepare&#34; CS teachers in just a few PD
sessions.</p>
<p>
First time through, particularly when you&#39;re voluntold to teach a new
class you just want to survive. Follow that script, learn with your
kids and get through. You&#39;ll grow and the kids will be richer than had
you not gone through the fire with them.</p>
<p>
Two or three years down the road, however, if you&#39;re still just
following the script you&#39;re doing your students a disservice.</p>
<p>
Of course, having subject knowledge doesn&#39;t mean you have all the
answers but it lets you call that audible when a class needs something
that is not in the lesson plan or lets you talk about multiple
positions on subjects with no single best answer like coding style.</p>
<p>
And then calling an audible isn&#39;t always about making a lesson more
advanced. It can also be about sensing what a class needs at that
time. This is something I learned from Bruce Baskind at Seward
Park. I&#39;ve lost touch with Bruce but he was a mentor and a friend when
I started this teaching thing and without the support I got from Bruce
and a handful of others back at Seward, I wouldn&#39;t have made it.</p>
<p>
Sometimes, you&#39;ve got to turn off the academics. A class might need a
team building exercise or maybe just something fun. They might just
need to turn off school for part or all of the period. Sure, you burn
a lesson but sometimes that&#39;s what the kids need and at the end of the
semester, they&#39;ll be further along for it. I&#39;d sometimes take a block
of class time and do Story Time - literally right out of grade
school - usually something from <a href="https://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/k/u/kuc14/sunny/Children%20Literature/The%20stinky%20cheese%20man/stinky%20cheese%20man.pdf">The Stinky Cheese Man</a> like &#34;The Really
Ugly Duckling.&#34; In some ways it&#39;s related to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9KxKa8NpFxJYgovyJhF4HZRsAqYKBLiG">Halloween Stuff</a> I
used to do at Stuy. Those were preplanned but that was all about
relationship building with the class - the non academic stuff that
supports the academics the rest of the year.</p>
<p>
As this post is beginning to wander I think I&#39;ll stop.</p>
<p>
Next up - a specific audible I called that, at least for one student,
turned into a very memorable lesson.</p>
