            <p>
I&#39;ve been up in Providence RI since this past Wednesday for
SIGCSE2022. The big Computer Science Educators conference. Also, my
first in person conference since pre-covid.</p>
<p>
I wasn&#39;t sure how I was going to feel about this big in person
gathering but as it&#39;s turned out, it&#39;s been pretty comfortable.</p>
<p>
So far, I&#39;ve attended two terrific keynotes. One by Barbara
Liskov and the other Barbara Ericson, some really interesting sessions
and some less interesting ones and have had a great time discussing CS
education.</p>
<p>
The big highlight has been seeing friends in person and being able to
talk. Sitting down for coffee with a friend or having a rount table
discussion around a well, round table.</p>
<p>
One of those friends I was delighted to see was Alfred
Thompson. Alfred&#39;s already sumarized his <a href="https://blog.acthompson.net/2022/03/sigcse-2022-day-1.html">first</a> and <a href="https://blog.acthompson.net/2022/03/sigcse-2022-day-2.html">second</a> day
experiences so there&#39;s not reason for me to write much the same so I
figured I&#39;d just quickly list out a few of my highlights and in
particular things I plan to write more about when I get back to NYC.</p>
<ul>
<li>Language choice for APCS. There was a panel that considered why
change to Python or why stick with Java. I didn&#39;t attend this
session but talked at length about it with a number of people. It
had me reconsidering my opinions and I&#39;ll certainly write about this
in the near future.</li>
<li>I saw an interesting talk by Sam Lau in which he discussed how
statisticians and computer scientists differed in their views as to
how and what should be taught in a data science course. This got me
thinking about developing CS offerings at the high school level.</li>
<li>I attended the &#34;It seemed like a good idea at the time&#34; session for
the first time where teachers discussed their failures. This was a
<strong>great</strong> session hosted by two more friends I haven&#39;t seen since
pre-covid - Dan Garcia and Jim Huggins. One topic brought up there
was dealing with late assignments as well as alternative
grading. This too is something I plan to write about.</li>
<li>PD For CS Teachers and teacher prep programs. This is clearly
something I care deeply about and there were some sessions on this.</li>
<li>I also spent a good amount of time catching up with my friends Jim
and Robin from Siena College. They&#39;re doing some cool thing up there
so that&#39;s another thing I&#39;d like to write about.</li>
<li>I also had some good discussions with vendors in the exhibit hall as
well as some great hallway tract talks.</li>
<li>My thoughts on the hybrid format of this conference</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#39;s a big list - a lot of things to write about. I hope to get on
this when I get back to NYC on Sunday.</p>
<p>
In the meantime, if you&#39;re in providence for tomorrow&#39;s last day of
SIGCSE, please find me and say hello!!!!</p>
