<p>
I&#39;ve never met Julia but have been following her on Twitter and
reading her <a href="https://jvns.ca/">blog</a> for some time now.</p>
<p>
The tweet got me thinking. Not so much about learning on the job but
rather on how colleges prepare their students. Recent boutique majors
and concentrations notwithstanding, a degree in CS seems to have
largely stayed the same from the early/mid 1980s when I got my BA to
today. There are variations but it was and still is largely</p>
<ul>
<li>programming‚Äì&gt;data structures‚Äì&gt;algorithms</li>
<li>some systems or OS stuff</li>
<li>some theory </li>
<li>math: calc 1, calc 2, discrete, linear, maybe stats</li>
<li>another requirement or two which might differ based on institution</li>
<li>electives</li>
</ul>
<p>Sure, programs have changed over the years. At one point, computer
graphics was hot. Now, not so much. Courses like compilers also used
to be required more frequently but overall things look much the
same. That said, there have been some major changes - at least from my
perspective and those changes really affected how students were
prepared for professional careers. Now of course this is only my
perspective so who knows how accurate it is. Regardless, it should be
good food for thought.</p>
<p>
I got my BA back in the mid 80s. That was the start of the PC
generation. Colleges were starting to get computer labs full of
IBM-PCs and then  later clones. MS-DOS ruled the day. </p>
<p>
What did that mean?</p>
<p>
It meant that while a few years prior, students used a time sharing
system for their programming classes now they were using  an
IBM-PC with Turbo Pascal. I can&#39;t say for sure but looking back, it
seemed that people educated in PC heavy programs had a weaker sense of
all those issues that come with multiple people and multiple processes
happening on a machine at the same time.</p>
<p>
On the other hand, having a relatively simple computer - one that you
had full control over may have led to an easier time in understanding
the low level ins and outs. You could learn about low level issues on
a PC and really understand everything. That doesn&#39;t seem to happen as
much nowadays when even our personal computers and computing devices
run more like those multi user computers of old than the single
process no threads IBM-PC.</p>
<p>
There was an opportunity to recapture this right before the Arduino
got big. The Arduino was based on an Atmel processer with a small
instruction set - a platform where a student could understand
everything from wire to application. For all the good that the Arduion
and related projects have led to, they&#39;ve abstracted that low level
away.</p>
<p>
A few years later Java became a popular college CS language followed
by Python. Both of these took memory management out of the core
programming-&gt;data structures-&gt;algorithms sequence. Sure, you probably got to
learn a bit about memory management and related issues in your systems
classes but I have to believe you didn&#39;t really own that knowledge
like you would have had you had to manage memory throughout the core
courses.</p>
<p>
Now, I&#39;m not knocking the change. Moving to Java brought some
improvements and so does moving to Python. It&#39;s just that as a
language or platform giveth it also taketh away.</p>
<p>
The interesting things here is that the changes I noticed were not
directly intended but rather byproducts of changes made for other
reasons.</p>
<p>
A final unintended consequence I noticed also seems to be a byproduct
of the Java revolution. Years ago after many programs had adopted
Java I was talking to a friend who was a high level SE at a big NY
bank. At the time finance was NY&#39;s biggest tech employer. I think
Google might have recently moved to NY but wasn&#39;t yet the player
they&#39;d become - this was pre-IPO days and NY tech hadn&#39;t yet
exploded. My friend was lamenting after a long day of interviews. None
of his interviewees - all from top rated CS colleges could handle what
he viewed as easy algorithm questions. Questions a that were
considered close to trivial by his interviewees from a few years
back.</p>
<p>
After some discussion, we developed a theory. It might not be true but
looking around the landscape in the months and years following that
discussion, it might hold some water. With the acceptance of Java
students were now, more frequently using library calls. The .sort
method, the built in List, Tree, Map, and Set classes and more. This
is not to say that the students hadn&#39;t learned about, say, the
mergesort in their data structures or algorithms classes but rather
they didn&#39;t live it. Maybe  they did a quick implementation but then
it was gone from their memories.  Back in the day, most people in my
peer group started in Pascal and frequently moved to C. Even though C
had it&#39;s built in sort, we coded our own more frequently. We also
didn&#39;t have easy access to all the data structure and algorithm
libraries that Java had so we rolled our own and continued to use
them. When kids who did that interviewed, they could more easily see
how an interview problem related to an algorithm they coded and
tweaked half a dozen times. On the other hand, those that saw it once
and moved to a library didn&#39;t have that in depth understanding.</p>
<p>
Now, this is not to say that it was better in the old days. When they
removed memory management, they were able to add other
topics. Likewise when students didn&#39;t need to implement their own
version of everything for their class projects, instructors could
steer students towards learning other new things.</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not making a judgement call on better or worse but rather that
even without formal curricular changes the strengths and weaknesses of
our CS graduates have changed over the years quite possibly as a
result of unintended consequences of a variety of decisions.</p>
<p>
I also don&#39;t this only happens in CS. Take a look at math - the big
one would probably be bringing the calculator to the classroom. The in
your face change was the idea that on the one hand, students would
become weaker in arithmetic and manual calculation. On the other hand,
time could be spent on what might be considered richer topics due to
time saved. Lost in the shuffle were topics like linear
interpolation - a useful skill taught to navigate log and trig
tables. Those skills would be forever lost.</p>
<p>
So, there&#39;s my rant and ramble inspired by Julia&#39;s post.</p>
<p>
A day after I saw the tweet I saw <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/09/10/hashmaps-make-things-fast/">this post</a> by Julia. Unless some
shiny object distracts me I think I want to look at how the unintended
consequences from some of the changes I mentioned directly relates to
it.</p>
