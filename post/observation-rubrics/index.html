            <p>
There have been a lot of bad ideas foisted onto educators over the
course of my career. One of the ones that always pissed me off was the
use of a rubric for teacher observation. Specifically, using the
Danielson Framework. </p>
<p>
The Danielson Framework is a LONG laundry list of topics and concepts
and for each a teacher could be rated ineffective, developing,
effective, or highly effective.</p>
<p>
It&#39;s garbage.</p>
<p>
Sure, there are some good things in the framework but using a
restrictive rubric to judge a teacher is just a bad idea. Even the
frameworks creator, Charlotte Danielson publicly stated when this
nonsense got started that the framework should not be used to evaluate
teachers. Of course departments of education would give a nod nod
wink wink and say &#34;no, it&#39;s not for evaluation, it&#39;s for teacher
improvement.&#34;</p>
<p>
I remember talking to a colleague at Stuy. She hated the Danielson
Framework that was being forced on teachers for observations. She was
known to be a strong teacher but according to Danielson, she was off
the charts good. She reason she hated it was because she recognized
that her teaching style just happened to map well to the framework du
jour and eventually it would be a different rubric and she would no
longer be good.</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve actually seen this happen - teachers going from good to bad or
the reverse based on an observation rubric. The teacher didn&#39;t change,
nor the students but change the rubric and you can get the results you
want. Good, or more frequently bad, I mean it was then Governor Cuomo
who said that his teacher evaluation metric was clearly no good
because too many teachers were scoring well.</p>
<p>
Why am I bringing this up? Because student teachers. My CS Education
Masters program is about to have it&#39;s first graduates and New York
State will have it&#39;s first two newly certified CS teachers with said
degrees. They&#39;re both finishing up our program with a last course (CS
Topics) and student teaching. Both of our student teachers will have
to be officially observed three times and ultimately I&#39;ll have to rate
them and enter those ratings into Hunter&#39;s system.</p>
<p>
I&#39;m ranting on Danielson because Hunter uses said framework to
evaluate its student teachers. Like an institution, Hunter&#39;s a complex
beast and there&#39;s both good and bad but seeing what is essentially the
Danielson framework being used to evaluate student teachers knocked
them (us) down a peg in my book.</p>
<p>
Now, from a top down approach, using something like Danielson makes
sense. It gives a series of check boxes making things easy to measure
even if they&#39;re the wrong things. It also made sense back when it came
to be because of the leadership model espoused by people like Michael
Bloomberg where he would take young teachers with a year or two of
experience and make them principals. A horrible idea which persists to
this day. Traditionally, an AP or P would have decades of teaching
under their belt. They knew what a good lesson looked like. Not
Bloomberg era principals. I mean, it takes a dozen years before you&#39;re
really an intermediate stage teacher. A two year principal doesn&#39;t
have a chance nor a clue.</p>
<p>
The bottom line is that good (and bad) teaching is so varied and
nuanced that you can&#39;t boil it down to a rubric. All you can say are
things like look for questioning, engagement etc..</p>
<p>
My approach to observations was set by my first supervisor at Seward
Park High School. He was a master teacher. Just ask him. Unlike many
APs who just teach honors or the top level class, he would rotate
classes among his entire department. He would teach everything from
calculus to remedial math. He&#39;d say &#34;those kids deserve me too.&#34; Yeah,
he was arrogant, but he really was a master teacher. He was also great
if he liked you but a horror if he didn&#39;t. Fortunately, he liked me.</p>
<p>
He said that the one thing you have to keep asking yourself when you
observe a class is &#34;is learning happening.&#34; It&#39;s that simple. Then,
it&#39;s up to you as the observer to figure out where, how and why and
what you can suggest to make it better (while observing the cardinal
rule of not fixing the lesson). This makes all the sense in the world
to an experienced educator and it allows them to hone in on an
observee&#39;s strenghts and weaknesses while also adjusting for the class
and circumstances.</p>
<p>
If you&#39;ve got good observers and trust them, it works and works very
well.</p>
<p>
What don&#39;t work? Detailed rubrics by non teachers.</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, right now, this is just another idiotic idea that
teachers are forced to deal with and just another thing driving
teachers away from the profession.</p>
<p>
Will the powers that be ever learn? Probably not so for now it&#39;s up to
good supervisors to shield their teachers from the nonsense and I
hope, in my capacity, when I&#39;m able I can do the same.</p>
