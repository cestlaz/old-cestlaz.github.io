One of the first sessions of SIGCSE2022 was a panel on the choice of
language for APCS-A. Should it continue to use Java or should it shift
to Python. This topic comes up from time to time. I didn&#39;t attend this
particular session but discussed it at length with a few people who
did.</p>
<p>
Truth be told, I wasn&#39;t going to start writing about SIGCSE and APCS-A
until I finished a few other SIGCSE posts but my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/alfredtwo">Alfred
Thompson</a> said he was writing one and was planning on posting it
soon. I think it&#39;s better when us CS Ed bloggers write about similar
things at similar times - fosters better discussion so I&#39;m writing
this today (Sunday) and will post it as soon as I see Alfred&#39;s post.</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot to unpack when it comes to language choice for
APCS-A. Language strengths and weaknesses, ease of learning, tooling
and training costs and more. I&#39;ll share my feelings on all of these
and maybe more but before we dig into those I think it&#39;s worth
thinking about the intent of the course.</p>
<p>
The AP program was originally created to allow advanced high school
students to get started on college work in their field of interest. An
AP class would either be the first course in a major or it would be a
requirement like calculus is for CS majors. There were fewer exams and
FAR fewer students taking them.</p>
<p>
Over time, things evolved and today that&#39;s not necessarily the
case. APCS-A, Calc and many others still fit the bill but then you
have classes like AP Euro - sometimes offered to HS sophomores and is
really a regurgitation course. Sorry but a class appropriate for HS
sophomores is not college level. Same for APCS-Principles. Might be
good, might be bad but it&#39;s not college level.</p>
<p>
So, before deciding on the language you really have to decide on
intent. If APCS-A is to be the first class in the CS major then the
college board has to really follow what colleges are doing. Some
people think that APCS-A should be a course for everybody or for non
CS majors but if the class is supposed to be a first in major course,
it <strong>has</strong> to follow the college lead.</p>
<p>
If colleges decide to make their CS1 a more general course, more about
APIs, less about either programming or, to it&#39;s already limited extent
algorithms and data structures, then it&#39;s fine to change but as long as the
college board is pushing CS1 as a first course in the CS major then
APCS-A has to follow the general CS1 outline.</p>
<p>
So, assuming this stays the same, you might still argue a change to
Python. I&#39;ll look at the pros and cons of doing this at a later post but one
argument against the change is that students having taken CS1 in
Python have a harder time transitioning to Java (or C++) in CS2.</p>
<p>
Some people say this isn&#39;t an issue but I think it is. APCS-A is
already frequently a watered down CS1 and students sometimes struggle
in CS2 even when it&#39;s in the same language. Switching languages will
result in kids hitting a brick wall. This is an example of a problem
I&#39;ve seen over and over again - people changing a class because they
feel there&#39;s a need but not paying attention to the next class let
alone the full pipeline.</p>
<p>
This happened at Hunter recently - I warned the department that it
would but nobody listened. Our CS0 course up until my first
year at Hunter was a pretty bad course It was a random assortment
of topics with a lot of cruft and it just didn&#39;t serve anybody. In my
second semester the class was slated to change to a new course. The
new course was going to have more programming - all in Python - lots
of small programs. It was a much broader class and we all agreed that
it would be much better. It was except for one thing. Nobody was
paying attention to how well it prepared students for our CS1 and that
first CS1 class after the new CS0 was full of complaints, student
struggles, and student failures. On the one hand, the new course had
more programming than the earlier one but since it was only tiny
programs, students weren&#39;t prepared for CS1 right out of the gate but
students thought they were prepared. Things have gotten better since then
but the problem was easily to predict.</p>
<p>
If High Schools move to a less rigorous class with an &#34;easier&#34;
language like Python great care should be taken to make sure that it
prepares students to jump into a college CS2 which won&#39;t have nearly
the supports that are present in high school.</p>
<p>
So that&#39;s it for this installment. Before you can even think about
language you have to think about class intent. Now that we&#39;ve done
that we can start looking at language choice. That&#39;s for next time.</p>
