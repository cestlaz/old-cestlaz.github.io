I read a post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/">/r/emacs</a> the other day asking if people used Emacs
bookmarks among other things. I thought about it for a bit and
wondered why I didn&#39;t use Bookmarks? I did set a few bindings to load
frequently used files and those are like bookmarks but I have to set
those up in my configuration. It turns out that Emacs bookmarks are
pretty easy and effective and work right out of the box. I cover the
basics in the video and you can also check the documentation <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Bookmarks.html">here</a>. </p>
<p>
In the video I mention that the bookmark bindings are part of the
bindings used for registers which also include rectangles. If you&#39;re
interested in those aspects you can find out all about registers by
viewing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1YoF4ycLTY">this nice video</a> by Prot and I cover rectangle editing <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-28-rectangles/">here</a>. </p>
<p>
I also noticed another post on /r/emacs about <a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/burly.el">burly</a> - a package for
managing windows and their associated buffers. It&#39;s pretty cool. In
the video I confused myself and thought it might be mapping the
buffers to windows wrong but that was just me confusing myself. </p>
<p>
Burly uses bookmarks to store the configurations which is cool and it
was much easier for me to get my head around it than other
solutions. Burly&#39;s install instructions use <a href="https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa">quelpa</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa-use-package">quelpa-use-package</a> so now it looks like I&#39;ll have to figure those out
as well :-).</p>
<p>
The run through is all in the video.</p>
<p>
Enjoy.</p>
