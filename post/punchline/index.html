Commenting on my post on teaching some <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/post/same-old-topics/">Software Engineering</a> concepts,
there was a comment on code review and that code.org now included it
in their CS-A curriculum. I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWddHWU3_YM">this video</a> but no other materials. I
was thinking that I certainly hoped that the video was not being used to
introduce code review to students. I mean the video is fine and
probably great to show to teachers so that they&#39;ll have some idea on
what code review is and why it&#39;s important. For students, it would be
giving away the punchline too early.</p>
<p>
There are times when you, as a teacher, have to directly instruct
students and there are times when just seeing a good practice is
sufficient but code review isn&#39;t one of them. Why do I feel that way?
Because I&#39;ve seen code review in the wild. Sure, some, and I&#39;d hope
many professionals take it to heart but I know too many cases where
testing and code reviews are afterthoughts. People click okay based on
reputations or cursory glances or often based on deadlines and don&#39;t
take the time to really review code.</p>
<p>
For students to buy into code review, they have to really see why it&#39;s
important and useful.</p>
<p>
It&#39;s somewhat like teaching version control, which I do with Git and
GitHub. I teach it early because I use it as a means of distributing
and collecting software but truth be told, students don&#39;t really buy
into the program. They only &#34;get&#34; version control later on when it
saves their bacon. I haven&#39;t cracked the nut of making version
control meaningful early on but I think I have done a pretty good job
with code review (<a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/post/code-review-2/">old post</a>, <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/post/code-review/">other old post</a>) and it involves having
them do some activities before revealing what we&#39;re really doing or
giving them the punchline.</p>
<p>
Sometimes you&#39;ve got to give the info up front but sometimes you want
to set up exploration, discussion, and discovery. Most teachers know
this but not all. I remember three years ago, we had our first CS
teacher cohort. We started with 22 teachers but one dropped after the
first week. That one teacher insisted that we tell them everything
that was coming up in detail. I explained that we could share some
things in advance but giving away the punchline would lessen their
experience and how much they got out of the program. A couple of days
later they were gone. The other 21 bought in and together we had a
great program.</p>
<p>
So, most teachers get it, but not all. On the other hand I&#39;m not
convinced that most content providers get it. Yes, they&#39;ve heard all
the buzzwords but I&#39;m not convinced that most of them have really
experienced educators (let alone CS educators) driving their ships, I
mean, it is a profession where it takes decades to become a master
teacher and to me, 5 to 10 years is really advanced beginner to
intermediate and I don&#39;t think you really master your craft util
around 20 and that&#39;s only if you continue to work at it.</p>
<p>
Some people might push back on that last paragraph but if you&#39;re a
5-10 year teacher, as yourself this - do you expect to stay the same
and not get any better for the rest of your career or do you expect to
continue to grow and get better. If you do expect to grow than what
you will become will be the master teacher version of yourself. If you don&#39;t expect to grow,
you&#39;re probably in the wrong business.</p>
<p>
Anyway, I digress.</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know what materials code.org put together for their whole code
review unit. If the video is intended to show at the start or if
they&#39;ve got something more developmental but it got me thinking about
our craft, how it&#39;s important to give the right information at the
right time, to guide but not to give away the punchline until the time
is right.</p>
