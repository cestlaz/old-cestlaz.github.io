Day 8 took a lot longer than the other days. Not all that much code
and not too complex, at least after getting through a scary sounding
lead up but going from problem statement to solution took both time
and thought.</p>
<p>
As I started to read the problem, I wasn&#39;t sure I&#39;d finish it let
alone have time to write it up.</p>
<p>
Take a minute to read over the problem. You can find it [[<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/8">https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/8</a>

<p>
A pretty intimidating wall of text. </p>
<p>
You&#39;ve got a bunch of lines, each looking like this:</p>
<pre class="example">
be cfbegad cbdgef fgaecd cgeb fdcge agebfd fecdb fabcd edb | fdgacbe cefdb cefbgd gcbe
</pre>
<p>
Each &#34;word&#34; represents a seven segment display. The side to the left
of the | is the input for that line and the stuff on the right, the
output.</p>
<p>
The problem is that each line has the inputs scrambled. We jave to
figure out which letter maps to the top segment, which the bottom,
etc.</p>
<p>
Oh boy.</p>
<p>
It turns out that part one really wasn&#39;t hard at all. In fact, it
could make a nice early CS assignment. If you look at the display for
a <strong>1</strong>, it has two segment on the right hand side. It&#39;s the only number
that uses 2 and only 2 of the seven segments. Likewise a <strong>4</strong> is the
only four segment letter, <strong>7</strong> is the only one that uses 3 segments,
and <strong>8</strong> is the only one that uses all seven segments.</p>
<p>
For part 1 you just had to look at all the outputs  - that is, the
stuff on each line after the | and add up the number of items that
are either a 1, 4, 7, or 8. That&#39;s easily accomplished by going over
each of those items and checking if they have the correct number of
characters and then figuring out the total number of these items.</p>
<p>
I had already parsed my data into the a two item list where the left
item is a list of inputs and the right a list of outputs:</p>
<div class="src src-clojure">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-clojure" data-lang="clojure"><span style="display:flex;"><span>[ [<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;cg&#34;</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;cdbga&#34;</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;bcg&#34;</span> ...] [<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;geac&#34;</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;ceag&#34;</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;faedcb&#34;</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;cg&#34;</span>]]</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
So all I had to do go through all the output sides, count the characters in
each item and then add up the number of them.</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s the code:</p>
<div class="src src-clojure">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-clojure" data-lang="clojure"><span style="display:flex;"><span>  (<span style="color:#66d9ef">defn </span>myfilter [x]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;takes a list of numbers and returns only those that are 2,4,3, or 7&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    (filter <span style="color:#f92672">#</span>(contains? <span style="color:#f92672">#</span>{<span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">7</span>} %) x))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  (<span style="color:#66d9ef">defn </span>part1 [  data]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    (<span style="color:#66d9ef">let </span>[results (map second data) <span style="color:#75715e">;; pull out all the outputs</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>          counted (map <span style="color:#f92672">#</span>(map count %) results) <span style="color:#75715e">;; turn the &#34;words&#34; into counts of their lengths</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>          f (map <span style="color:#f92672">#</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">myfilter</span> %) counted) <span style="color:#75715e">;; only keep the ones that are the right lengths</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>          total (map <span style="color:#f92672">#</span>(count %) f) <span style="color:#75715e">;; count how many are in each line</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>          ]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>      (apply +  total))) <span style="color:#75715e">;; add them all up </span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  (<span style="color:#a6e22e">part1</span> data)</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
For part 2 we had to decode all the output lines and then turn them
into numbers and add them up.</p>
<p>
Sounded really daunting. It required some thought but it wasn&#39;t that
bad.</p>
<p>
I wanted to build a dictionary where the keys were the digits and the
values would be the segments for that particular input line that
represent  that digit.</p>
<p>
For a given line, we can do it pretty easily for the unique numbers 2,
4,3, and 7 so we just loop through all the items in a line  and when
we see an item with the appropriate length, we store the number in our
dictionary.</p>
<p>
We might have something like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th class="align-right">key</th>
<th>value</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="align-right">1</td>
<td>b e</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="align-right">4</td>
<td>b c e g</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="align-right">7</td>
<td>b d e</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="align-right">8</td>
<td>a b c d e f g</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
These were the values from the first line of the example data. Also, I
used a Clojure set  to store the values since that makes the rest of
the solution easier.</p>
<p>
I then took this dictionary and tried to add to it by figuring out the
5 segment numbers - specifically, 2, 3 and 5. It turns out that of the
5 segment numbers, the <strong>3</strong> is the only one that ovelaps with the two
segments from the <strong>1</strong> so we can find that one pretty easily. If the
five segment number wasn&#39;t a 3, I looked to see if it was a 5. For
this, I looked to see if it had the left and middle segments that the
4 had. Finally, if it wasn&#39;t a <strong>3</strong> or a <strong>5</strong> then it had to be a <strong>2</strong>.</p>
<p>
Next, I did the same for the remaining segments which were all 6
segments. You can look at my full code (linked below) for specifics.</p>
<p>
Once we had the complet dictionary I flipped it - keys became values
and values became keys so we could look up the output numbers. From
there, it was easy to convert them to numbers and find the final
answer.</p>
<p>
The part of this problem that was both fun and challenging was trying
to figure out how to decode a given letter given what you already
figured out. That took some time but getting the final answers for
problems like this are somehow more satisfying than just a straight up
&#34;code it&#34; problem.</p>
<p>
You can find my full solution <a href="https://github.com/zamansky/advent2021/blob/main/src/day08.clj">here</a>.</p>
<p>
I was worried I wasn&#39;t going to finished this one when I first read it
but I think it&#39;s my favorite of the year so far.</p>
