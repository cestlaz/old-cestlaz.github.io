No post so far on <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/12">day 12</a>. I finished part 1 but my code was pretty
messy which turned part 2 into a mess. I still have to go back to get
that second star so just like day 10, my day 12 write up is on hold.</p>
<p>
That said, I really enjoyed [[<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/13">https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/13</a>
][today&#39;s]] challenge. Paper foldind. You&#39;re given transparent paper with
a bunch of marks on it. You have to fold the paper over horizontal or
vertical lines and examine the results.</p>
<p>
Input was in the form of lines x,y pairs followed by lines specifying
the folds.</p>
<p>
First decision - data representation. Since we&#39;ve got a grid,
temptation would be to use a 2D structure like a 2D array but there
are two problems. One is that each fold will make the paper smaller
and smaller which makes a 2D array wasteful if not clumsy. The other
issue is that we don&#39;t know the ranges for our coordiates. We know
that all the values will be positive but we have no idea where they
start and end.</p>
<p>
Just like with the cellular automaton, I decided to use a dictionary
where the key was  the x,y pair and the entry was the mark. I could
have used a plain list for the points but the dictionary gave me quick
lookup. Also, if part 2 had us change the marks based on if they
overlap after a fold, I&#39;d be prepared.</p>
<p>
For convenience (and as I learned later, part 2) I also wanted a
routine that could print the board. Here&#39;s that routine in case you
want to see some clojure.</p>
<div class="src src-clojure">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-clojure" data-lang="clojure">
  (<span style="color:#66d9ef">defn </span>board-&gt;string [board]
    (<span style="color:#66d9ef">let </span>[maxx (apply max (map first (keys board))) <span style="color:#75715e">;; find the largest x</span>
          maxy (apply max (map second (keys board))) <span style="color:#75715e">;; find the largest y</span>
          k (keys board)

          <span style="color:#75715e">;; The next line makes a vector of maxy vectors</span>
          <span style="color:#75715e">;; each of which has maxx spaces</span>
          <span style="color:#75715e">;; basically a vector of vectors or 2D matrix if you would</span>
          grid (into [] (repeat (inc maxy) (into [] (repeat (inc maxx) <span style="color:#e6db74">\ </span>))))

          <span style="color:#75715e">;; go through the keys to our board (which is a hash table</span>
          <span style="color:#75715e">;; and mark those squares with a #</span>
          filled-grid (reduce (<span style="color:#66d9ef">fn </span>[b [y x]] (<span style="color:#a6e22e">assoc-in</span> b [x y] <span style="color:#e6db74">\#</span>)) grid k)

          <span style="color:#75715e">;; change each line from a vector to a string</span>
          <span style="color:#75715e">;; but leave the overall thing a vector since</span>
          <span style="color:#75715e">;; it looks fine when I print it.</span>
          string-grid (map <span style="color:#f92672">#</span>(apply str %) filled-grid)
          ]
      string-grid
      ))</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
Once we have our &#34;board&#34; we can then deal with folding. Folds had to
be over a horizontal (ex: y=7) or vertical (ex: x=5).</p>
<p>
It was important to note that since we&#39;re folding we only want to take
the points with coordinates greater than the folding line and
transform those and not just transform all the points.</p>
<p>
The actual transformation is pretty straightforward. Given the line&#39;s
coordinate L the new point value can be calculated using:</p>
<pre class="example">
newcoord = oldcoord - 2 * abs(oldcoord-L)
</pre>
<p>
We just go through the points and if they have to be transformed,
update them.</p>
<p>
Part 1 solved.</p>
<p>
Part 2 turned out to be far easier than I expected. Part 1 had us just
do the first fold. Part 2 had us do all of them at which point, if we
printed our board it would show us the 8 secret letters that formed
our anwer. Since the example on the problem page was a y fold and the
first fold of my data was an x fold I knew both my folds worked. I
just ran through all the folds and voila.</p>
<p>
Now, I&#39;m not complaining about an easy problem. If it were harder I
might not finish and then no write up but I was expecting something
more.</p>
<p>
There were ways to make part two a bit more complex. I could see maybe
placing the data so far off the end so that you had to translate them
down closer to the origin so that your result would print or maybe do
something with overlapping marks when you fold as I mentioned up top.</p>
<p>
Still, nothing wrong with an easy day mixed in and I still think it&#39;s
a great problem. This could be done by a CS0 or CS1 class. What I
particularly love about problems like this is that when you
ultimately solve it you &#34;decode&#34; a secret message. Much cooler than
just getting some number.</p>
<p>
So, over half way done. I still have that part 2 of day 12 to finish
but still captured half the total stars for the event. That&#39;s my
starting goal each year.</p>
<p>

Enjoy.</p>
