 The basic gist is that you have a plane ticket which is a set of numbers but you don&#39;t know which number maps to which category - row, seat, gate, etc. You also know the number ranges for each category. For example, row might be a number between 6 and 11 or 33 through 44 while a seat might be 13 through 40 or 45 through 50." />

Today&#39;s problem was a fun one to solve. Why was it fun? Stay tuned,</p>
<p>
The basic gist is that you have a plane ticket which is a set of
numbers but you don&#39;t know which number maps to which category - row,
seat, gate, etc. You also know the number ranges for each
category. For example, row might be a number between 6 and 11 or 33
through 44 while a seat might be 13 through 40 or 45 through 50. </p>
<p>
Finally, you also can see a number of nearby tickets - each also as
tring of numbers. </p>
<p>
For part 1 you had to determine how many of the nearby tickets are
valid. A ticket is valid if all the numbers on it fall into at least
one category range. </p>
<p>
See the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/16">full description</a> for all the details. </p>
<p>
First up - parsing - a little cumbersome but not too bad.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Split the input into the three main sections - categories, your
ticket, nearby tickets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Convert the categories into a usable form</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Convert your ticket into a list of numbers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Convert the nearby tickets into a list of tickets each one being a
list of numbers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Taking each step in turn and it&#39;s not too bad - particularly if you&#39;re
comfortable with regular expressions.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-1">
part 1
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Representing the categories leads us to our first interesting
decision. How will we test to see if a ticket is valid and based on
that how will we represent the categories?</p>
<p>
Each category has two ranges connected with an <strong>or</strong>:</p>
<pre class="example">
row: 6-11 or 33-44
seat: 13-40 or 45-50
</pre>
<p>
One could make a construct to hold the bounds, loop through the nearby
tickets and for each value, run an if statement with the two ranges
connected by an <strong>or</strong>. </p>
<p>
This is where a class can talk about code vs data - a topic I&#39;m really
fond of.</p>
<p>
Instead of taking the above range and having some test like: </p>
<p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> number <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> ticket:
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> (number <span style="color:#f92672">&gt;=</span> low1 <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> number <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;=</span> high1) <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> \
     (number <span style="color:#f92672">&gt;=</span> low2 <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> number <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;=</span> high2):
       do something</code></pre></div></p>
<p>
or specifically for the row example:</p>
<p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> number <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> ticket:
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> (number <span style="color:#f92672">&gt;=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span> <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> number <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">11</span>) <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> \
     (number <span style="color:#f92672">&gt;=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">33</span> <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> number <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">44</span>):
       do something</code></pre></div></p>
<p>
you could make a set with all the possible seats  and then just test
to see if the seat was in the set: </p>
<p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">r1 <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> set( range(low1,high<span style="color:#f92672">+</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>))
r2 <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> set( range(low2,hight2<span style="color:#f92672">+</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>))
valid_seats <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> r1<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>union(r2)

<span style="color:#75715e"># then later</span>
<span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> seat <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> valid_seats:
  do something</code></pre></div></p>
<p>
I just find this more elegant. </p>
<p>
For part 1 I just made a big set with all the valid seats and then
checked each ticket to see if each if its numbers were in the valid
seats. </p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-2">
part 2
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
For part 2 first you had to remove all the invalid tickets from the
nearby tickets. Since you figured out how to identify a valid ticket
in part one this shouldn&#39;t be too ahrd.</p>
<p>
Then we have to sleuth out which column from the tickets represented
which category. This would make a great group activity in a class,
particularly with an interactive language. This is a great data
exploration and representation problem.</p>
<p>
To get more data, I thought I&#39;d write a routine to pull all of one
column from the nearby tickets. Then I could see if all the values in
that row were valid for a particular category. For example, are all
the first numbers of all the tickets valid numbers for row. If so,
that column could represent row. Of course it could also represent
something else as well.</p>
<p>
Now that i could test to see if a column is valid for a category I
decided to build some data. I built a list of all the possible
categories for each row.</p>
<p>
Part of it looked sort of like this (but in clojure):</p>
<p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">[ [<span style="color:#ae81ff">17</span>, [<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;wagon&#34;</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;arrival-station&#34;</span>] ],
  [<span style="color:#ae81ff">7</span>, [<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;wagon&#34;</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;arrival-station&#34;</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;route&#34;</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;train&#34;</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;row&#34;</span>]]
<span style="color:#f92672">...</span>
]</code></pre></div></p>
<p>
Examining this table, I noticed that one row had only one category,
another had only 2 then one three etc. Great - we can now solve this
by plugging in the row we know, then the next one, then the next etc.</p>
<p>
The explorations led to an easy answer. I sorted the list and looped
through. At each iteration I: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Added the current category and its associated row to the solution
set.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removed that category from the rest of the lines</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When done we had a dictionary with a mapping from category to
row. From there it was pretty simple to find the part 2 answer.</p>
<p>
Lots of good stuff here. I love the data explorations and the way it
can lead to a pretty straightforward solution.</p>

<p>
So far I&#39;ve managed to complete each day - 32 stars. That beats my 31
from last year adn my top year of 40 back in 2016. Tomorrow I give my
last exams and grading ca really begin so we&#39;ll see if I can keep
going but so it&#39;s been a fun Advent of Code year so far.</p>
