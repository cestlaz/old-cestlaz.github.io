Yesterday I wrote about the virtues of a simple straightforward
solution as opposed to a super &#34;clever&#34; one. Today reminded me that
what seems simple to one person might be clever to another.</p>
<p>
Having successfully survived bingo with a giant squid, Today&#39;s
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/5">challenge</a> had us navigating our sub so as to avoid dangerous parts of
the ocean. We were given a bunch of lines represented by endpoints as
input. If we graphed all the lines, some of them would overlap. The
more the overlap, the more dangerous. Given all the points on the
graph that are covered by a line, we had to determine how many points
were covered by two or more lines.</p>
<p>
For example, if we have the following 10x10 grid with 1,1 being the
upper left adn 10,10 the lower right and the following lines:</p>
<pre class="example">
1,2 --&gt; 8,2
3,1 --&gt; 3,7
2,4 --&gt; 7,4
6,1 --&gt; 6,8
</pre>
<p>
we&#39;d have the following lines:</p>
<pre class="example">
..X..X....
XXXXXXXX..
..X..X....
.XXXXXX...
..X..X....
..X..X....
.....X....
.....X....
..........
..........
</pre>
<p>
If instead of X we marked each square with the number of times it was
drawn on we&#39;d have</p>
<pre class="example">
..1..1....
11211211..
..1..1....
.121121...
..1..1....
..1..1....
.....1....
.....1....
..........
..........
</pre>
<p>
In the above example, the answer to part 1 would be 4 since 4 squares
have more than one line on them</p>
<p>
Here our lines are all vertical and horizontal. For part 1 we only had
ton consider horizontal and vertical even though the input might
specify diagonals.</p>
<p>
Part 2 required we also deal with diagonals but only the ones with a
45 degree angle.</p>
<p>
For a relatively new programmer the obvious solution would be to
create a 2D array. Then you just have to scan through the data and
fill the array. Finally, go over the array and count the cells that
were hit more than once.</p>
<p>
This approach presents three problems. The first, which is minor is
that you&#39;d first have to scan the input to determine the required
array size. The second problem is that you could have negative values
in your input so you&#39;d have to somehow compensate for that
possibility. Finally, you could have spares input. What if there were
only two lines but one was from -1000000,-1000000 –&gt; -999999,999999
and the other from 1000000,1000000 –&gt; 1000001,1000001. You have two
tiny lines but you&#39;d need a HUGE array.</p>
<p>
For me, an easier, simpler solution was to use a dictionary (also
called hash table, or map depending on language). My grid would start
as an empty map and then I&#39;d add points by walking the line segments. For
example if I had a line from 0,0 –&gt; 2,0, I&#39;d add three entries to the
map. The keys would be (0,0), (1,0), and (2,0), and the values would
be all 1 since each location was hit once.</p>
<p>
If I then added the line (1,0) –&gt; (1,2), I&#39;d end up with this final
map:</p>
<div class="src src-python">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">  {(<span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>) : <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>,
   (<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>) : <span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>,
   (<span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>) : <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>,
   (<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>) : <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>,
   (<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>) : <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>}</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
Note that the (1,0) entry now has a two since it was hit twice.</p>
<p>
Once we added all the lines, pull out the values and count how many
are greater or equal to two.</p>
<p>
Once armed with this approach it was easy enough to solve the
problem. You can check out the code <a href="https://github.com/zamansky/advent2021/blob/main/src/day05.clj">here</a>.</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll maintain that I used a simple, clear, and maintainable approach
but it&#39;s also worth noting that if I presented this problem to
relative beginners, depending on what tools they&#39;ve used, they might
very well lean heavily on an array representation. This would
certainly be true when I was a beginner - we never saw maps or
dictionaries until we built them in our data structures courses. Now,
with students cutting their teeth in languages like Python where
dictionaries come up much earlier, perhaps today&#39;s beginners would
also opt for the map / dictionary solution.</p>
<p>
In any event, I always like problems like this where there are
multiple ways of representing the data in the solution which leads to
some nice food for thought.</p>
