Now that I&#39;ve done posting about <a href="/post/retiring-1-why/">why I&#39;m retiring</a> we can get back to
our usual blogging.</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t really done anything technical over the past couple of
year. The most programming I did in the past 18 months was a
halfhearted effort at the Advent of Code 2021 event last December. I
thought I&#39;d see about picking up a new language to change that. In
doing so, I was reminded of some of my resistances to learning a new
language and how I&#39;ve seen similar from self taught students coming
into my classes.</p>
<p>
Of course my situation is different - I&#39;m doing this wholly by choice
and once a student is in a class they&#39;ve got to use the prescribed
tool.</p>
<p>
The contenders on the functional side were Haskell and OCaml and on the
other side, mostly Rust.</p>
<p>
Today, we&#39;ll talk about the functional side. I decided to look at
OCaml. I had briefly looked at it well over a decade ago but barely
scratched the surface. Haskell I played with a little more deeply but
not much. I decided on OCaml because it was supposed to be more real
world and, to be honest, I get turned off by some of the holier than
though purely functional talk that sometimes occurs.</p>
<p>
Funny thing is that I&#39;ve had a really hard time getting going - so
much so that I decided that for now I&#39;d explore Rust.</p>
<p>
So, what&#39;s going on?</p>
<p>
OCaml looks to have some nice features. It&#39;s functional and I&#39;m a fan
there and it&#39;s also supposed to be pragmatic - you can get real world
stuff done with it. It&#39;s also statically typed which overall I think
is a good thing and it has cool features like pattern matching.</p>
<p>
For pattern matching, I&#39;m not talking about things like regex or
matching characters in a string but rather something like a really
cool and powerful case or switch statement. Even that description,
though is not doing it justice.</p>
<p>
I think my problem is that I already am comfortable and enjoy
programming in Clojure. Clojure is functional and pragmatic but while
Clojure doesn&#39;t have pattern matching built in but there is a library
that basically accomplishes the same thing. As to the type system,
Clojure is dynamically typed and while that would be an issue if I
were working on large real projects and/or on a team, I&#39;m just writing
little toys by myself. If I want stronger typing, there are ways of
doing that in Clojure. True, it&#39;s not required but working by myself,
I have that option, should I choose. It&#39;s not the same - I know but as
I said, I&#39;m not doing anything big, important or with other people
right now.</p>
<p>
So, basically, every time I try to dive in to OCaml, I end up feeling
that &#34;I can already do that and do it better in Clojure.&#34; I&#39;m guessing
I&#39;d feel the reverse had I started on the OCaml side. </p>
<p>
This has happened to me before. I was an early Python adopter feeling
that it was a huge improvement over Perl. A while later, Ruby came out
and shortly after that, Ruby on Rails became a thing. Every time I
looked into Ruby I had to stop - I could already do and do better in
Python. By then, there were enough tools to compete with Rails even
though they weren&#39;t as mainstream and overall I preferred Python. I
never did end up learning Ruby.</p>
<p>
I felt a similar sluggishness when I went from C++ to Java - something
I had to do because of the AP Exam change but I pushed through since I
had to teach it and ultimately, I&#39;ve learned to appreciate the good
and curse the bad of both languages.</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve seen similar blocks or resistance from who&#39;ve had prior
programming experiences over the years. From students who seemed
to be taught more &#34;the language&#34; rather than CS using the language. I
know that&#39;s a nebulous thing to say but I think some of you will catch
my drift. It&#39;s subtleties like saying &#34;okay, we&#39;re repeating this
process, here&#39;s how we do it in language such and such&#34; vs &#34;here&#39;s how
we repeat this process period&#34; and show the language construct.</p>
<p>
My former math chairman at Stuy said he once, back in the 80s asked Marvin
Minsky what they should be teaching for CS in High School. Minsky
said, and I paraphrase, &#34;nothing, you&#39;ll only mess them up. At most
teach them to type.&#34; Of course that was a different time and I
<strong>strongly</strong> disagree with that statement but I do think we have to look
at how students entering our classes are or are not prepared and
adjust accordingly. </p>
<p>
So, in the end, it&#39;s back to Clojure for me on the functional side and
I&#39;ll try to do an OCaml dive sometime in the future.</p>
<p>
Fortunately, I&#39;m having an easier time getting in to Rust. More about
that next time.</p>
