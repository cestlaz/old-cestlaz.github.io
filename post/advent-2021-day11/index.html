I wasn&#39;t particularly motivated to start <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/11 ">day 11</a> but took a look over
coffee. A grid of points where on each turn or step the points are
modified by some rule. Hey, this sounds familiar - cellular automata
like Conway&#39;s Game of Life.</p>
<p>
You set up your grid and then on each turn just follow the rules. In a
traditional Cellular Automaton like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway&#39;s Game of Life</a>, on each
turn each cell looks at its six neighbors and makes a decision as to
its next state based on the neighbors and a rule.</p>
<p>
For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway&#39;s Game of Life</a>, a cell is either alive or dead. On each
turn, it counts all it&#39;s neighbors and then decides if it will be
alive or dead next turn based on its current state and how many
neithbors are currently alive.</p>
<p>
I love talking about Cellular Automata in class although I haven&#39;t
done it since my Stuy days. One of my favorite topics is using CS to
solve a maze in NetLogo. I wrote about that <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-01-17-maze-ca/">here</a>.</p>
<p>
Cellular Automata is also not a stranger to Advent of Code with three
problems being CS problems in 2020 and I think there were more in
earlier years.</p>
<p>
This year the twist was that the rule for each step had two stages and
the second stage could repeat over and over again.</p>
<p>
The first stage was just to increment the value of each cell. The
second involved &#34;flashing.&#34; This would happen if a cell&#39;s value
exceeded nine. If a cell flashed, it would increment the value of each
of its neighbors. This could cause a cascade by having a neighbor&#39;s
value exceed nine. This kept going until the board stabalized. You
also had to account for the fact that a cell should only flip at most
once per step.</p>
<p>
Part one had you calculate the number of flashes over the course of
100 steps.</p>
<p>
When I do CA in a class like APCS-A we usually use a 2D array to
represent our world. In NetLogo, the world is already a grid. Since
I&#39;m using Clojure, I though a hash table would be easier. The keys are
x,y coordinates and the values are the state of the cell (the integer
value). To set things up I stole the code from my code from last year,
also coincidentally <a href="https://github.com/zamansky/advent2020/blob/main/src/day11.clj">day 11</a>. My <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day11/">write up</a> also talke about using a hash
table or dictionary instead of a 2D array.</p>
<p>
The first stage of each step was easy. Just map the increment function
across the entire board.</p>
<p>
The second step took more thought. First, I went through the board and
for any cell that was greater than 9 I incremented all its
neighbors. Then to make sure I don&#39;t flash a cell more than once a
turn, I marked the current cell as being flashed. I did this by making
it a large negative number.</p>
<p>
I repeated that second step over and over until it stabilized. That
is, you went through an iteration where the board didn&#39;t change - no
new flashes.</p>
<p>
Finally, I set all the negative cells, which indicated they flashed to
zero in preparation for the next step.</p>
<p>
In the loop I counted and added up how many flashes we had and that
was part 1.</p>
<p>
For part 2 you were looking for a step where every cell flashed at the
same time. This was pretty easy because we were able to essentially
use the same engine. The only difference was that instead of doing 100
steps, you kept going until every cell flashed in one turn. That
turned out to be easy to check. You know that happened when all of the
cells at the start of a turn are 0.</p>
<p>
As usual, the full solution can be found on <a href="https://github.com/zamansky/advent2021/blob/main/src/day11.clj">GitHub.</a></p>
<p>
Wasn&#39;t motivated to start today but it turned out to be a fun little
challenge.</p>
