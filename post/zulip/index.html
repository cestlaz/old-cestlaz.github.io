It&#39;s always been a challenge to get students to buy in to an out of
class communication tool. Over the years I&#39;ve tried many including
mailing lists, Piazza, Discourse, Vanilla and other discussion forums,
Slack and probably a few other things.</p>
<p>
I guess it&#39;s not surprising that it&#39;s a hard sell - prior to the
internet once school was out kids there as no teacher student
interaction until the next school day and kids would only interact
with their direct friends. </p>
<p>
Still, we have technology and even without great buy in, if nothing
else there&#39;s an advantage to having an electronic means of
distributing things to students.</p>
<p>
Ultimately I fell back on a plain old mailing list. Discussion/forum
platforms didn&#39;t work for me because it was yet another location that
you had to remember to check. Slack didn&#39;t work because at its core
it&#39;s for live chat and while workers are at their desks all day and
can have a chat open, that doesn&#39;t work with students and catching up
on a complex Slack with threads after the fact is, well, just no. </p>
<p>
With us going remote in Coronatime needs changed. Slack looked like it
might be more viable. It still had the problem of limited threads but
in addition to students being more &#34;always on,&#34; for better or worse,
live remote teaching benefits form a chat. Why Slack over the built in
Zoom chat? Well, one thing is that the Zoom chat disappears after the
session whereas Slack lives on and can form the base for ongoing
discussion. Second, dedicated chat platforms like Slack are more
robust and featureful.  </p>
<p>
Over the summer and into this semester, Slack seems to be working very
well for my teacher certification candidates but I ended up using
something else - <a href="https://zulip.com">Zulip</a> for my undergraduate classes and plan to move
my teachers over to it for the next cohort.</p>
<p>
Why the change? Both Zulip and Slack have free tiers but Zulip can
also be self hosted and is open source. Slack is slicker when it comes
to integrations but Zulip is the clear winner for combined sync and
async conversations due to its threading model combined with flexible
alerts. </p>
<p>
I put together this short video showing  the basics - check it out:</p>

<p>
You can use Zulip free on their site with similar limits as for
Slack&#39;s free tier or you can self host. I&#39;m running our Zulip
instances on a Digital Ocean droplet. DO has a &#34;one click&#34; Zulip setup
that was fairly straightforward. You might want to check that out if
you&#39;re comfortable as a Linux admin.</p>
<p>
So far, I&#39;m liking Zulip very much and thing I&#39;ll be using it as my
primary in and out of class communication tool. I&#39;d like a better
selection of emoji and wish it was easier to both use integrations and
write bots but the thread based interface is really great. </p>
<p>
I know Slack&#39;s the big name and I do like Slack as well but if you&#39;re
a teacher and looking for an in and out of class chat/communication
platform check Zulip out.</p>
