You don&#39;t become a master teacher overnight. It takes years, perhaps
decades. Year one, you&#39;re just trying to survive. Year two is
frequently a small step back. Year three on is slow improvement
provide the teacher works to improve. To me and eight to ten year
teacher is usually an advanced beginner, fifteen years?
Seasoned. Master teacher? You&#39;re probably pushing close to 20 years or
more. Of course, there are exceptions but this is the pattern I&#39;ve
most often observed (burnout notwithstanding).</p>
<p>
Why such a long developmental timeline? Part of it is the feedback
loop. At best your cycle is one semester but more often than not it&#39;s
a year. You do something once and then you don&#39;t really know if it
worked until way later if ever. You also can&#39;t try it again until
next year and even then, it&#39;ll be with different students and possibly
with all sorts of different variables. </p>
<p>
That&#39;s why I was happy when this semester ended and I felt that I
finally got one of my classes to where I wanted it. It only took five
years. Actually five years but having taught it 8 times over those
five years.</p>
<p>
The class in question is the lab/recitation for Hunter&#39;s CSCI13500 -
essentially CS1. For the non-Daedalus sections, they basically do a
programming lab per week. For me, my students do those labs albeit
usually outside of class time and we do enrichment. One of the
challenges is that I have to follow the lead of the main course
instructor who designs the labs and controls the class sequence. I
have some leway but I can&#39;t for instance decide to teach classes way
earlier.</p>
<p>
Over the eight iterations I&#39;ve tried different different things but I
think I&#39;ve finally settled on what and how things happen in the
class.</p>
<p>
While I still follow the thirteen labs given by the mane instructor in
sequence, they use Gradescope and I use GitHub Classroom. I also use
unit tests to grade the labs which gives me a platform to develop the
idea of testing both in general and as an industry practice. We go
from nothing to discussing testing and me providing test cases to them
designing their tests for later labs. Since we&#39;re using GitHub
Classroom that allows us to leverage that as well. We&#39;ll talk about SE
practices like using version control, build tools (make), code review,
etc.. This is all part of the enrichment which also includes students
working on projects started by other students.</p>
<p>
We also do some direct CS enrichment by extending some of the
labs. Two labs that have been used recently have particularly lent
themselves to extensions. One was a lab based on rotational ciphers
which I extend by covering a decoder and there&#39;s a 2D image lab based
on arrays that lends itself to all sorts of extensions - I like seam
carving.</p>
<p>
This is what I landed on but I also tried other things that didn&#39;t
work and some of this will change in the future. The point is that it
took years. I couldn&#39;t do something one week and then immediately try
something else. Sure, you can do that with specific teaching
techniques but not with a class overall.</p>
<p>
One of the other classes I&#39;m still tweaking is CSC23500 - essentially
data structures. I taught it for decades as part of APCS-AB but
Hunter&#39;s a new audience - different circumstances, different
constraints, and differnet advantages. First time through I wasn&#39;t
super happy with my performance. Second year I made some positive
adjustments and was happier - Covid mid semester notwithstanding. This
year, I think I got the structure down. It was remote and during Covid
so there were other challenges so I won&#39;t really know until the fourth
iteration but I think I&#39;m getting there.</p>
<p>
So, all this is to say that improvement in teaching and improvement in
classes doesn&#39;t happen overnight. Education is the long game.</p>
