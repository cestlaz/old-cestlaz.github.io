So, since we discussed <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/post/cheatgpt/">cheating and chatGPT</a> and decided that there

<div id="outline-container-headline-1" class="outline-2">

General use
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The first go to seems to be as an alternative search engine. It hasn&#39;t
been uncommon seeing people say they use chatGPT instead of searching
StackOverflow. This makes sense. ChatGPT gives answers and the natural
language interface can make it easier to form some questions or ask
for results in a particular format. Interesting though is that it
seems, and I have no evidence for this, that people will more accept a
&#34;written text&#34; answer from chatGPT as factual as opposed to a listed
search result. This is worth thinking about since chatGPT doesn&#39;t
always give correct answers to questions so buyer beware.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-2">
In non CS classes
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
For more interesting ideas, I&#39;ll start outside of my comfort zone -
non CS classes. One of the big fears of chatGPT is that it will write
student essays. Why not leverage that as a feature, not a bug. As
chatGPT to write an essay and then have students analyze and critique
it.</p>
<p>
We&#39;ve all seen stories on how chatGPT sometimes gets the facts
wrong. How about leveraging that? Do some fact checking.</p>
<p>
I asked chatGPT to write an essay and to include at least three
errors. It created a reasonable essays and at the bottom listed the
errors. Of cousre, there could always be more. Take those essays and
have the students not only critique but fact check. Better, don&#39;t
initially fact check but have students build arguments based on the
documents you give them and let them learn to be critical of resources
when they discover they&#39;re not always correct.</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sure there are many more creative ways one can leverage generative
systems like chatGPT in educational settings but now let&#39;s move to CS
classes.</p>

<h2 id="headline-3">
In CS classes
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I wondered if chatGPT could help create problems. I asked it to create
a parsons problem. That was an epic fail. It gave me a Java program in
order. I guess I could then scramble the lines but that wasn&#39;t the
point.</p>
<p>
On the other hand, the answers it gave could be used as code tracing
examples so there may be some value there.</p>
<p>
I also asked it to generate test questions and small programming
assignments but I didn&#39;t find the output useful.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-4">
What else?
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
There&#39;s also been talk about creating lessons to either support or one
day replace teachers and with this, we&#39;re a <strong>long</strong> ways off.</p>
<p>
I asked chatGPT to write lesson plans on a number CS and non CS topics
and each time the result was the same.</p>
<p>
I got a formulaic lesson plan that technically covered the material
but I found them less than worthless. Yes, technically one could kind
of sort of work off the lesson plan but they were bare bones - no
interesting motivations, questions, possible tangents, or examples. No
potential segues or pitfalls and certainly nothing specific for any
teacher&#39;s actual students.</p>
<p>
To a non teacher the lesson plans might look alright but to any decent
teacher, they&#39;re worthless. If you&#39;re a teacher, you already know the
bare bones outline of any given lesson and if you don&#39;t you shouldn&#39;t
be teaching that subject. What makes the lesson work is everything on
top of the bare bones skeleton - the motivations, the examples, the
activities and here, chatGPT is of no help.</p>

The killer app
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
So far, it looks like chatGPT can be useful but it certainly has
limitations. I did find, however, the chatGPT killer app for
education. By find, I mean I saw someone else tweet out the
idea. Sorry I can&#39;t give credit but I didn&#39;t end up saving the link.</p>
<p>
ChatGPT can be used to create all the garbage that administrators and
politicians insist are important in education but are crap.</p>
<p>
Hey, chatGPT: &#34;Write me a lesson plan introducing loops that aligns to
the New York State Computer Science and Digital Literacy Standards.&#34;</p>
<p>
Hey, chatGPT: &#34;Write me a sub lesson plan on conditional statements in
Java.&#34;</p>
<p>
These are great. Sure, they&#39;re lousy lesson plans but they&#39;ll have the
references to the standards that administrators and other education
reformers love and now teachers don&#39;t have to waste their time on it.</p>
<p>
That&#39;s the killer app!!!!!!!</p>

Final thoughts
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
So there it is. A few thoughts on how we can productively use tools
like chatGPT. I&#39;m sure there are more and better ones out there and
I&#39;d love to hear about them so feel free to share yours.</p>
