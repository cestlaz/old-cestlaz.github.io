Back to calling an audible.</p>
<p>
Around seven years ago I was visiting with some former students at
Google in Mountain View. One of them from way back in the late 90s,
Pawel, out of the blue said there was one lesson I taught that was
particularly memorable. Not memorable in the &#34;that was fun&#34; way like
maybe my Halloween adventures but memorable in that he felt he got a
lot more out of it than a normal lesson. Pawel mentioned a few of the
things he still remembered about a lesson he saw over two decades
earlier. </p>
<p>
It was, in fact, one of the first big CS audibles that I can
remember calling. </p>
<p>
It was second semester APCS - probably right after the AB exam. I
guess I&#39;d been teaching around seven years so I&#39;d classify myself as
an advanced beginner. I also hadn&#39;t done any serious programming and
problem solving since I started teaching.</p>
<p>
Was I a fraud?</p>
<p>
Impostor syndrome was creeping in.</p>
<p>
Back then I had a bunch of students who participated in the <a href="http://usaco.org/">USACO</a> and
would discuss the programming from their competitions. While I talked
a good game, I started to wonder if I could back it up. Should I
really be telling these kids about best practices for problem solving
ad programming if I just talked the talk and couldn&#39;t walk the walk?</p>
<p>
To test myself, I decided to work through some of the competition problems. I figured
that I didn&#39;t have to be able to solve the hardest of the hard ones
since only the best of the best solved in that stratosphere but if I
should be able to solve or at least approach most of the advanced
problems.</p>
<p>
After some problem solving and coding I felt much better about
myself. I wasn&#39;t living a lie.</p>
<p>
I particularly liked the Digit Pals problem. Question 4 from the
1996-1997 <a href="https://www.angelfire.com/ca2/lorddave/usa974.html">National Championship</a>.</p>
<p>
Fast forward to class a few days later. Early in the period, for some
reason, I wasn&#39;t happy with where things were going so I decided to
totally change directions. I decided I&#39;d do a lesson that was
basically a walkthrough of my problem solving and coding process for
Digit Pals.</p>
<p>
I started by looking at the problem, working through example and then
some of the things we discussed included:</p>
<ul>
<li>data representation (2D array)</li>
<li>the high level logic of removing a digit pal (recursive flood fill)</li>
<li>the high level logic of sliding down and over</li>
<li>how to solve the whole thing.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the overall solver, I decided to go with a straightforward, blind,
recursive search. I figured it would be fast enough for two
reasons. First, I figured that since, if you remove the digit pal at
any location, it&#39;s the same as removing that pal from any of it&#39;s
locations so that there would likely be many many solutions and
second, there was a line in the problem statement saying that your
solution might not work on large cases. In any event, when all was
said and done and they released the test data, my solution worked
within time constraints.</p>
<p>
After the design phase, I went to the live coding with a focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>compiling and testing every concept. That is, a single loop, a
single if, a function etc.. This may sound excessive but I&#39;ve been
doing this forever and it&#39;s served me well as a hobbyist and as a
professional.</li>
<li>Implementing the data structure first - a 2D array and then a way
to print it so that I could always tell the state of my program.</li>
<li>incremental development - first remove a pal, then slide down, then
over, then the solver.</li>
</ul>
<p>When it was all over the problem was solved. I&#39;d like to think that
the students got something out of the audible. I learned years later
that at least one student did. As a teacher, I also got a lot out of
it. That day might not have been my first live coding lesson but it&#39;s
the earliest one I remember. It was all impromptu but it got me
thinking more deeply about how I approach problem solving and
programming as well as how to teach both. Even all the little things
like my compulsive compiling and testing.</p>
<p>
Funny - I have no idea what I was originally going to teach that day
but that audible turned into both a lesson I&#39;ve repeated many times
as well as concrete techniques that I&#39;ve used over and over through
the years.</p>
