One of the arguments for keeping APCS-A as is are the costs to
change. There are of course, many kinds of costs.</p>
<p>
The first are the monetary costs. New text book, curricular materials
and possibly equipment. The College Board has their development costs
but I don&#39;t care about those - they&#39;re raking in money hand over fist
anyway. I don&#39;t think these costs amount to much. Companies that sell
materials for classes are always trying to make sales and even when
subjects don&#39;t change there are always new books and other
resources. So, these costs shouldn&#39;t really figure into switching
languages.</p>
<p>
Another cost relates to ancillary effects. Does changing the language
or changing the course have an effect on how well or how poorly
students are prepared for what&#39;s to come. The argument here for
keeping Java is that CS2, data structures in most colleges is taught
in Java or C++ so switching APCS-A to Python wouldn&#39;t prepare students
as effectively. This may or may not be the case. Students already have
to deal with the switch from Java to C++ if they go to a C++ school
adn get placement out of CS1 and some colleges do indeed teach CS1 in
Python and then switch.</p>
<p>
So, changing languages won&#39;t necessarily hamper students that take
data structures in a different language in college.</p>
<p>
On the other hand, if the course content changes significantly -
changing from the A in APCS-A meaning Algorithm to API as Owen
Astrachan suggested at SIGCSE then that&#39;s a different kettle of fish. </p>
<p>
Digging a little deeper on this front is that when a college designs
their CS0, CS1, and CS2 classes they should look at the full
sequence - all three of these classes and beyond. If you change a
course, you really have to think about how it changes the future
ones. Hopefully colleges do this when changing curriculum but I did
talk about how Hunter didn&#39;t when it rebooted their CS0 class. Now,
this really isn&#39;t a reason to change or not to change since a high
school can&#39;t really track and pay attention to every colleges CS0,
CS1, CS2 sequence so I guess it&#39;s neither here nor there.</p>
<p>
I guess the bottom line for this cost is that as long as APCS-A
remains fundamentally the same content wise it may not matter what the
language is and if the College Board clearly states that APCS-A is
<strong>not</strong> going to be a college CS1 then any language is fair game.</p>
<p>
The biggest cost that people bring up is teacher training. All the
teachers will have to learn the new language and possibly a new
paradigm. This one is <strong>huge</strong>. I work with a lot of teachers who are
relatively new to CS and some of them are struggling their way through
APCS-A. These teachers are basically students in CS0 or maybe CS1 and
just finding there way to and through CS. Switching languages for them
is no easy feat and concepts in one language don&#39;t necessarily
translate to another. I&#39;ve seen teachers who claim proficiency with
Python or JS struggle to write the simplest of Java programs or after
spending a significant amount of time in Java they have similar
struggles switching to Python.</p>
<p>
In spite of so many people saying CS is easy and anyone can do it,
learning new things is in fact hard and takes both time and effort.</p>
<p>
As a side note, this cost flies in the face of every PD provider (I&#39;m
looking at you code.org) that claims &#34;we&#39;ve trained XXX teachers to be
CS teachers in just YYY sessions!&#34;</p>
<p>
This is the state we&#39;re in today but this is also a warning. We <strong>have</strong>
to do better with respect to teacher training so as to make this cost
meaningless.</p>
<p>
When I entered teaching, I had been doing C programming professionally
but knew Pascal along with other languages from college. Teaching APCS-A/B
in Pascal was easy. Well, the language was easy. I was a new teacher
so teaching overall was hard but teaching APCS-A/B wasn&#39;t any harder
than say teaching Trig or Linear Algebra. Actually, maybe it was a
little easier since I was a CS guy at heart and not a math
person.</p>
<p>
When the class switched to C++, I figured out C++. I had never done
OOP before but I figured it out. Switching to Java? Same deal. I also
taught myself Python, NetLogo and other languages that I had to or wanted
to teach with.</p>
<p>
The point is, I had a strong CS background so picking up a new
language wasn&#39;t really a major cost. It wasn&#39;t free - I had to spend
some time and at times figure out new tooling but it wasn&#39;t this
insurmountable thing.</p>
<p>
Right now, we&#39;re at a point where we can&#39;t really ask this of our CS
teachers. Too many are too new but we have to make sure that our
pre-service training programs and state requirements are such that in
the future we will have CS teachers that know enough CS so that a
language switch in a course isn&#39;t a big deal. Rather, a teacher will
be able to do an analysis of the new tool solely based on asking if
it&#39;s right for their students.</p>
<p>
So, those are the costs. Are they enough of a reason to keep Java? I
don&#39;t think so. If you give enough lead time, as pre-service programs
are getting up to speed you can minimize the training costs. Just
give it 10 years instead of 5. Of course, you have to be confident
that Python will be the language that far into the future.</p>
<p>
That said, I&#39;m not advocating for a switch to Python. We still have to
go back to my first post on this - The College Board has to decide if
this will be a college CS1 class or something else and only then can
we do the language vs language analysis.</p>
<p>
Are we done with this thread? Almost but I think it&#39;s worth spending
some time looking at some possible alternatives to both Java and
Python.</p>
<p>
That&#39;s next time.</p>
