A big part of the CS4All movement has been making computer science
available at all grade levels. Of course that can mean many
things. Grade levels could be elementary, middle, and high school or
it can me k-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-12 or maybe even every grade.</p>
<p>
Does it mean required at every level or just an option?</p>
<p>
This has led to many discussions and, at least from the ones I&#39;ve
listened in on, the prevailing feeling from the CS side is all CS all
the time.</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know if this should be the case. It&#39;s important to think about
other factors - bang for your buck, budgets, student workload,
available faculty, what are the other requirements, and more.</p>
<p>
This question also isn&#39;t limited to computer science, or at least it
shouldn&#39;t be. K12 schooling is still a zero sum game - there are only
so many minutes in a school day and while CS is important, so too are
most if not all of the other subjects and some, like art and music are
in danger or being left by the wayside at the expense of CS. Of
course, on the other hand, there are some subject that I feel are
already given too much time or the wrong amount.</p>
<p>
That said, this post is about CS. We have neither the funds nor the
faculty to offer CS as a requirement in every grade but is it even
necessary? I don&#39;t know. An important part of offering CS in K12 is so
that it&#39;s on a student&#39;s radar so they can consider studying more
after HS. This is particularly important with some colleges requiring
students apply as a CS major before even attending. Another side is to
give a student the base level knowledge that we feel every educated
person should have just as we seek to do this in biology, chemistry,
history and so on.</p>
<p>
I know that we can accomplish these goals with a single class
requirement and two years of offerings overall . How do I know this?
Because we did this at Stuy. Doing this requires two basic things:</p>
<ol>
<li>A well taught, well designed intro course that exposes students to
the subject.</li>
<li>Covering enough material deeply enough so that students are well
prepared for the next steps in college should a student take them.</li>
</ol>
<p>The required intro gives the base level that everyone should have and
a more advanced follow up elective sets students up for success if
they want more in college. Truth be told the required course should
really be a year rather than a semester but we still made it work.</p>
<p>
This fits well in the Stuyvesant program and given New York graduation
requirements adding a single required course or even a required year
fits pretty easily and adding electives also isn&#39;t a problem.</p>
<p>
If you can&#39;t offer or require more then this can be enough. The
question, though, is - &#34;is it ideal?&#34; I&#39;d be hard-pressed to say that
a school should require more than a year of CS. If you do it right and
follow up with electives a year is plenty. If you don&#39;t do it right,
well, then multiple years of bad CS isn&#39;t any better than 1. </p>
<p>
What about earlier grades? Middle school? Standalone CS is nice but is
it necessary or are we better off embedding CS into other classes? I
haven&#39;t landed on an opinion on this but I do know that we&#39;ve had a
few middle school teachers graduate from my State Certification
Program and I&#39;d love to get their opinions over the next few years. 
As a general statement, I think it&#39;s safe to say that if you can fit
in some meaningful CS in middle school that would be great but if I
had a choice to either require it in middle school or in high school,
I&#39;d opt for HS. Middle school is too far from college and work. Why
would I say this? Because of what I&#39;ve noticed. There were periods of
time where CS, or at least programming or web dev were introduced in a
lot of Stuy&#39;s feeder schools and more often than not, when I surveyed
students about past experiences they either barely remembered them
(wait, I think I did something like making a web page in 7th gradeâ€¦)
or in any event based on my surveys, it made little difference towards
either success in High School CS nor in interest in doing more CS.</p>
<p>
Finally, the primary grades. When the whole CSforAll thing got started
I noted that a lot of what we&#39;d see in the elementary schools would be
a rebranding of stuff that already being done in schools that can
afford it - logic, problem solving, algorithms etc and also a
relabeling of already taught concepts using CS or CT vocabulary. This
is all good stuff and since it&#39;s more foundational it&#39;s probably
pretty important. Of course, when schools and teachers had the freedom
and budget, this was already happening prior to the CS movement even
if we didn&#39;t call it CS.</p>
<p>
So, do we need CS at all levels? Probably not. Would it be nice? Sure
but we&#39;re not serving kids if we&#39;re just CS zealots. We have to look
at the big picture and the whole student. If I ran a school system and
could only afford CS at one level I&#39;d go high school as I outlined
above. If I could do two, I&#39;d hop down to elementary school and then
fill in middle last. Of course, that&#39;s just me.</p>
<p>
Of course non of what I&#39;ve said talks at all about digital citizenship
or fluency but that&#39;s for another day.</p>
