I think I&#39;ve carved out a somewhat unique career. Never set out to be
a teacher and a couple of different turns here or there and things
could have been very different. When I started teaching, I thought I&#39;d
probably, if anything  become a math chair and that was actually the
plan at Stuy until Richie Rothenberg, the math chair at the time
unexpectedly passed away in the late nineties. </p>

Pre Hunter recap
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Just a quick recap. I started my career as a Programmer Analyst at
Goldman Sachs back in the day. I&#39;d say Software Engineer but that
title didn&#39;t exist back then. From there I went into teaching for two
decades, mostly at Stuyvesant.</p>
<p>
At Stuyvesant I built the CS program, created classes, trained teachers and
shepherded hundreds, perhaps thousands of students towards tech
careers. My continued relationships with these former students left me
in a unique position as someone with strong CS chops, strong teaching
and education chops along with professional programming experience and strong ties
to the tech industry.</p>
<p>
During this time, I played my part in getting the
ball rolling for K12 CS Ed. Certainly at Stuy but I&#39;d like to think
beyond it as well.</p>

The Hunter chapter
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Almost seven years ago, I came over to Hunter to work on two major
projects. One was to develop and run an undergraduate honors computer
science program at the college and the other as to create and run
computer science teacher certification programs.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-4">
Undergraduate CS Honors
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Prior to my joining Hunter, they already had a long established CS
department and program. It was (and is) both as good as any other
program out there and as bad. There were though, a few particular
issues. First, Hunter&#39;s program was either unknown to high school
students or had a poor reputation due to the misconception that a
liberal arts school can&#39;t do good CS and, at the tech company end,
Hunter was a total unknown. </p>
<p>
Hunter&#39;s program was a typical college CS program in that it did a
great job preparing strong applicants for grad school but did nothing
to prepare them for tech careers and there was no connection with the
NY Tech industry.</p>
<p>
When I started, top tech companies never recruited at Hunter and most
Hunter students never even applied for internships prior to
graduating - they didn&#39;t know they were supposed to.</p>
<p>
Over the past 7 years there have been tremendous changes.</p>
<p>
My first cohort had 8 students. My latest has 64. My honors program and Hunter CS in general is
now a known CS destination in many NY high schools. Applications have
grown from around 50 to many hundreds and each year I field more and
more calls of students trying to decide between my program and other
top CS programs - I win some, I lose some.</p>
<p>
On the exit side, my Daedalus students regularly end up at top tech
companies and the overall profile of Hunter CS is much greater and
more positive in the tech world.</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve created new classes that integrate software engineering practices
with traditional CS and built many unique partnerships and programs over
the past 7 years.</p>
<p>
My trouble is that the Daedalus program is in full swing. It has to be
maintained but the job is basically done. At the same time, I don&#39;t
have the ability to get the reforms I&#39;ve brought to my program to the
greater Hunter CS population. Sure, I&#39;ve gotten some initiatives
started that are available to all Hunter students but a lot of the
core stuff that I&#39;ve worked into my courses are only available to the
Daedalus students and I don&#39;t have a way of changing that.</p>
<p>
So, I think I&#39;ve done what I can do. The original goal was to create
this honors program and I think we&#39;ve gone well beyond. Hunter, and
Daedalus in particular, has a higher profile with high schools and
employers and Daedalus students get the best of CS, the practical
software engineering skills they&#39;ll need and unique partnerships with
the tech community.</p>

Teacher Certification
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
My other major hat was on the K12 CS teacher side. First we had to
lobby the state to create the certification. I visited Albany a number
of times and spoke to my share of Regents but the real heavy lifting
went to Hunter&#39;s President and the Dean of the Ed school.</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, I created our masters and certificate programs while
doing my part in the whole K12 CS effort. I created new classes and
worked with some of my old teaching pals from Stuy to get ready to run
the program once the state approved everything. </p>
<p>
Three years ago everything got really rolling. Hunter had the first active
certificate and masters programs in the state. Thanks to the generous
support of Gotham Gives, we were able to start a cohort of 21 working
teachers towards CS certification. They were joined by 2 masters
students.</p>
<p>
A year later, New York State had its first certified CS teachers. </p>
<p>
The following year, again with support from Gotham Gives, this time
joined by Google, we started another 24 working teachers along with 5
more masters students.</p>
<p>
Now in our third cohort we&#39;ve got another 56 working through the
programs.</p>
<p>
By the time our third year ends, we&#39;ll have around 100 certified CS
teachers in New York City.</p>
<p>
I&#39;m equally proud of the fact that we&#39;ve got five teachers from the
Fingerlakes region in our program.</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been pretty vocal over the years as to what I think a good CS
teacher looks like and I&#39;m super proud that our brand of CS teaching
can now be found across the city and in fact across the state.</p>
<p>
If you
think about the number of students these teachers reach each year,
that&#39;s pretty amazing.</p>
<p>
I&#39;m equally proud of the fact that these cohorts are still in touch
and forming a new community of CS teachers in the city and state.</p>
<p>
Now that we&#39;re rolling, what&#39;s next? The program needs to continue to
run but I don&#39;t see major changes. There are more things to get done
at Hunter and in the state. Things like getting the state to separate
HS from early grades in terms of certification and integrating some CS
teacher prep in our elementary school programs but, right now, I don&#39;t
see a path for the former and don&#39;t have the energy for the latter.</p>

Other hats
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
I&#39;ve also done a number of other one offs or side projects while at
Hunter. Some of them have been:</p>
<ol>
<li>I was on the executive committe and a lead author in creating the
NY State K12 CS standards. Something I find ironic since I&#39;m not a
fan of &#34;state standards.&#34;</li>
<li>I mentioned earlier that I was a big part of Hunter winning and
administering the CUNY2X grant. Got to work with some great people
and that whole grant was huge in helping move the needle on Hunter
CS.</li>
<li>I was also fortunate enough to work on a project funded by the
Robin Hood foundation on CS in the primary grades. It also allowed
me to work with some great people while dipping my toes in CS Ed
research and early grade work. </li>
<li>Prior to Covid we were also well on our way in developing a nice
little K12 CS teacher community hosting monthxly meetups at tech
companies like Google and Digital Ocean.</li>
</ol>
<p>
So, there it is, the major initiatives I&#39;ve been working on at Hunter
and what I think I&#39;ve accomplished. I&#39;m proud of the work and in all
cases I think we went farther than we originally set out for.</p>
<p>
What&#39;s next? I&#39;m not entirely sure. I&#39;ll share some thoughts in my
next post. I hope all my friends read it and keep an ear open if the
right opportunity presents itself.</p>
