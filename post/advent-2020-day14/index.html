Time for <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/14">Day 14</a>!!!</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t write up day 12 but here&#39;s a Clojure <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8fvaAZRtts&amp;feature=youtu.be">video</a> runthrough. I also
didn&#39;t write up day 13 mostly because I hacked together my part 2 in
Python and still want to rewrite it in decent clojure. In any event,
all my solutions are up on <a href="https://github.com/zamansky/advent2020">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>
Day 14 had a few interesting things going on. At its core it&#39;s a small
machine simulator where you have to deal with binary numbers. One of
the rubs is that the numbers are 36 digits which could be a problem if
your language / machine uses 32 bits to represent integers. </p>
<p>
Right off, assuming you have large enough ints you have an interesting
choice. Do you work with the data them as numbers or do you just do
string manipulations. </p>
<p>
I decided to do part 1 as numbers which leads to a nice little
exercise of using bitwise logic operations to turn bits on or off. </p>
<p>
Part 2 was better solved, at least for me using string
manipulations. That part had a nice little recursive subproblem -
mapping wildcard values in the &#34;mask&#34; to all the possible combinations
of zeros and ones.</p>
<p>
Both problems also had a bit of fun parsing and, at least for me, a
few neat clojure constructs. </p>
<p>
I think you could turn this problem into a fun set of class
exercises. My code can be found <a href="https://github.com/zamansky/advent2020/blob/main/src/day14.clj ">here</a> and even if you don&#39;t do Clojure,
you might want to check out the video runthrough:</p>
