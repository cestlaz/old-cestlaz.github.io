Over on Facebook the semi-regular &#34;is APCS-A going to Python&#34; once
again appeared. I&#39;m not going to get into Python vs Java. Each language giveth and
each language taketh away but it got me thinking about the history of
language changes.</p>
<p>
I titled this &#34;Language choices for APCS&#34; not APCS-A because back in
the day it was just APCS. At some point that split with APCS-A being similar
to what we have today and APCS-A being that plus a CS2 (data
structures) class. Finally after 2009, APCS-AB was dropped due to low
participation, I mean, my school represented 10% of the total test
takers - that&#39;s nuts - 10% from one school.</p>
<p>
I took the exam during the first administration in 1984 and taught
APCS-AB from 1991 I think up until I left Stuy.</p>
<p>
Originally, APCS was in Pascal. Back then, the course guide said that
they intended for the exam to become language agnostic but that never
happened. Instead we went to C++ in 2000 and then to Java in 2004.</p>
<p>
Now, I don&#39;t have any inside information here. I&#39;ve never been in on
any internal meetings so this is all just conjecture but I think it&#39;s
interesting food for thought. </p>
<p>
Back in 1984, schools were transitioning from either no
computers or Commodore PETS to Apple IIs. At Stuy, where I was a
student, the teacher had a single copy of a Pascal compiler on a
floppy disk and he made copies - one for each computer in the lab. Not
too much concern about piracy here. </p>
<p>
As we approached 2000 when APCS switched to C++ the knocks on Pascal
were: </p>
<ol>
<li>It&#39;s a teaching language </li>
<li>You can&#39;t have programs that were more than one file. </li>
<li>It wasn&#39;t Object Oriented which gained a lot of steam over the
decade. </li>
</ol>
<p>The first item was also mentioned as a strength and item 2 really
wasn&#39;t an issue in terms of what most people taught. In any event, the
College Board decided on a change. </p>
<p>
I started thinking about why C++ over Pascal? I know that C++ was the
hot industry language at the time and to be honest, I don&#39;t remember
what other languages might have also been viable. I did think though
about one big factor in C++&#39;s favor. By this time schools were moving
to IBM PCs and C++ had a really big hidden value - the existence of
Turbo C++. A C++ compiler and IDE that ran on the IBM PC and was
cheap. Prior to Turbo Pascal and Turbo C/C++ schools didn&#39;t have the
ability to cheaply compile programs and certainly students who were
fortunate enough to have computers certainly couldn&#39;t afford a
compiler. </p>
<p>
I have no idea if this factored into the decision but I think the
economics and the fact that compilers and development environments
were just not that available back then are an interesting bit of
history.</p>
<p>
What about the next change? C++ to Java in 2004. By then I had moved
Stuy over to Linux but most schools were still on Windows. By this
time there were more affordable and even free compiler choices so I&#39;m
guessing school economics didn&#39;t have to enter the decision. What
probably did was the fact that APCS-A participants were stagnant and
APCS-AB were declining. One might conjecture that the complexity of
C++ had something to do with this. While Pascal also had memory
management C++ memory management is more complicated and less
forgiving. Also, since C++ is really a multimodal with &#34;many ways to
do it&#34; it was probably much harder for both students and teachers,
many of whom didn&#39;t have a CS background. Java was the hot up and
comer, was not multi-modal but was indeed object oriented, and really
is a much simpler language. </p>
<p>
Now, as I said, I have no idea what was discussed internally at the
college board but I think it&#39;s interesting to think about the history.</p>
