ChatGPT in education has been all the rage but there&#39;s another twist
on AI that was getting some buzz even earlier - AI based code
completions. GitHub&#39;s Copilot has gotten the most air time but there
are others out there as well.</p>
<p>
When you code with Copilot, you type in a function name and maybe a
comment above it and the AI system will fill in the function.</p>
<p>
A canonical example seems to be Mergesort. Type in mergesort, hit the
magic key, and the function appears.</p>
<p>
I was asked by a friend how this might affect teaching programming and
I&#39;ve been thinking about it for a while.</p>
<p>
I was going to share my thoughts today but realized that first, we
have to talk about products like Copilot as a programmers aid and then
we can talk about it as a learning tool. Today, we&#39;ll cover the former
and next post the latter.</p>
<p>
Now, I&#39;m not a professional programmer - at least I haven&#39;t been one since
before I started teaching. I&#39;ve done personal projects, some one off
contracts and a few applications for work but I haven&#39;t written one of
those since I wrote a resume/interview managing system when Hunter won
the CUNY2X grant.</p>
<p>
Even so, I think I&#39;ve got a few thoughts worth sharing.</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s first consider what these tools can do right now.</p>
<p>
I started by playing with the mergesort exampe. I asked for it and the
AI&#39;s obliged. This could be seen as a time saver but is it? It turned
out every time I tried I got a good basic mergesort but the merge part
was always another function call - still had to write or generate
that so it&#39;s not just specify and move on. It&#39;s specify, verify, and
then either tweak or move on. It also wasn&#39;t optimized in any way. You
can decide for yourself if that&#39;s good or bad. </p>
<p>
A pro can tell me if using Copilot in this sense is a
time saver but I&#39;m not so sure. Even if it is, wouldn&#39;t most
programmers just use the built in sort function? It seems like in this
sense, tools like Copilot are like using a library but with inline
expansion and without verification. A mixed bag at best.</p>
<p>
Even if the AI always got it right and was clear I wonder how much
time would really be saved. Most of my time programming is spent
thinking and editing and Copilot is about the generating. I don&#39;t
doubt that it can be useful but in it&#39;s current state, maybe not so
much.</p>
<p>
The big benefit using it this way is if you ask it to write something
that you don&#39;t know how to write but is that really a good idea given
that the code still has to be verified?</p>
<p>
The other sense I&#39;ve seen these tools used in is more like how Gmail
autocompletes sentences in your email. Again, very cool but I&#39;m not
sure how useful. For the Gmail stuff, I always see the completions but
almost always just continue typing. I guess it&#39;s similar to how a fast
typist frequently won&#39;t fix errors, they&#39;ll retype them. For example,
if you accidentally type Froderick instead of Frederick, a fast typist
probably wouldn&#39;t fix the o. They&#39;d probably delete the word backwards
and retype it. More keystrokes but they stay in the flow. </p>
<p>
So, right now these tools seem cool but maybe not all that useful. I
could see benefit today by having them generate language idioms like
&#34;sum a list&#34; - things that templates and current autocomplete can&#39;t
quite do but can be verified on the fly in no time but that&#39;s about it.</p>
<p>
In the future, however things could change.</p>
<p>
The idea that at some point one could generate code from a description
is pretty appealing. Of course, that brings a challenge that many
beginner programmers have to deal with - specification. I tell my
students all the time &#34;Computers are lousy at doing what you want them
to do but great at doing what you tell them to do.&#34; Writing a program
for these not-yet-existing AIs will be all about writing
specifications and the specification will turn into our program. This
really isn&#39;t too different than what goes on today. A for loop is a
higher level specification for some gotos and conditionals. A foreach,
a higher level specification of a for and when you add in Lisp like
higher level functions like map and filter that&#39;s higher level
still. An AI like a future generation of Copilot can be just that.</p>
<p>
My verdict? Are they cool? Yes. An aid to productivity? I&#39;m not
sure. Will they get there? Probably but I don&#39;t know when.</p>
<p>
Next time, we&#39;ll talk about how these tools can change the landscape
of teaching and learning programming.</p>
