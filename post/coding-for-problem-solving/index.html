Like most CS educators I&#39;m a regular reader of Alfred Thompson&#39;s
blog. Alfred&#39;s <a href="https://blog.acthompson.net/2021/09/define-learn-to-code.html">latest post</a> is spot on but there was a line in it and a
particular Twitter response that reminded me that we so often forget
a big reason why people learn to code.</p>
<p>
Alfred mentions, as did that Tweet about coding to solve
problems. What problem are you trying to solve. This is the mainstream
push - programming helps you solve problems. I&#39;ve noticed a doubling
down on this with all the efforts (including mine) to integrate CS
into other subjects. While where and how much CS should be
integrated vs standalone is a topic for another day, integrating CS
into other fields is very much a &#34;help solve the problems of that
field&#34; approach.</p>
<p>
Nothing wrong with all of this. It&#39;s all good stuff but there&#39;s
another side to the coin. It&#39;s a side that I sometimes forget about
from in the trenches. In fact, a few years ago I was rambling on and
on about programming as problem solving and my friend and fellow CS
teacher Peter Brooks reminded me - the question doesn&#39;t have to be
&#34;what problem do you want to solve?&#34; The question can be &#34;what do you
want to create?&#34;</p>
<p>
Sometimes we forget that programming can be an amazingly creative
endeavor. You can use it to make something brand new and there doesn&#39;t
necessarily have to be a problem to be solved.</p>
<p>
Fred Brooks puts it nicely at the start of his classic work &#34;The
Mythical Man Month:&#34;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure
thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by
exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so
easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand
conceptual structures….</p>
<p>
– Fred Brooks, The Mythical Man Month </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I also saw elsewhere, maybe by Fred Brooks, maybe someone else talking
of a programmer being like a painter but whereas a painter has oils,
brushes, and pigments to create on a canvas, the programmer has
programming languages to create on the computer. </p>
<p>
Maybe it&#39;s the push for &#34;practical&#34; education, maybe the integration,
maybe the focus on testing. I have no idea but it seems that we
frequently forget about the creative side of the equation.</p>
<p>
I mean, yes, the APCS-P specification does mention creativity in the
interestingly enough named &#34;Create Task:&#34;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Programming is a collaborative and creative process that brings ideas
to life through the development of software. In the Create performance
task, you will design and implement a program that might solve a
problem, enable innovation, explore personal interests, or express
creativity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
but it&#39;s after &#34;solve a problem&#34; and &#34;enable innovation.&#34;</p>
<p>
That creative side though shouldn&#39;t be forgotten. Some of my students
most memorable projects didn&#39;t solve a problem. I remember the
&#34;Cheerleader Simulator&#34; in NetLogo. No problem solved there but it was
a fun project. Another was Tamika&#39;s stupid mouse dexterity game. A
simple game of her own design. I say stupid not becuase it was really
stupid - it was great. Rather, I say stupid becuase that game caused
me to waste so much time that end of year when I should have been
grading!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
As we seek to engage a wider audience in CS we shouldn&#39;t merely focus
on the problem solving nor the making money. The creative side is
really important as well.</p>
