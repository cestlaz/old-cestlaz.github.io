<p>
I think I&#39;ve hit on the big points on APCS-A language but a couple
more remain. This time, let&#39;s look at alternative languages.</p>
<p>
When APCS started in 1984, Pascal probably made sense - it was the
primary learning language at the time. It wasn&#39;t really used in
industry but it was the language you cut your teeth on. A few years
later when I went from college to Goldman Sacks I found very few
companies using Pascal. C was big and there were more than a few
opportunities using PL/I and of course, lots of COBOL in the business
world but no Pascal to be found.</p>
<p>
Of course there&#39;s nothing wrong with that. A lot of people claim that
the language for APCS-A or college CS1 <strong>has</strong> to be a mainstream
language used in industry. It really doesn&#39;t. If someone is going to
continue through a multi-year sequence of classes for CS or a related
field it&#39;s safe to say they will be exposed to many languages and
tools and the one you start with isn&#39;t necessarily the one you end
with. Even if you insist on using an industry language, there are many
to choose from. Python is big in a number of areas but it isn&#39;t the
only game in town. Java and C++ are still heavy hitters and will be
for a long time and many other languages have enough traction to be
considered commonly used in industry.</p>
<p>
I thought here we could do some quick hits on some possible alternate
languages.</p>
<p>
For all of these, I&#39;ll be talking about the language as of the last
time I used it so in some cases, I could be <strong>years</strong> out of date but I
think you&#39;ll get the idea as to what I&#39;m driving at.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-1">
Racket (nee Scheme).
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Really quick here. I designed Scheme into my CS0 course at Stuy. I
think it works very well in that context. That said, it would be a
tough sell today. Racket/Scheme are not widely used in industry even
though you will find LISP variants here and there.</p>
<p>
I like it because the syntax is super simple. Just a handful of rules
and that&#39;s it. I also liked that it&#39;s syntax was different and new -
it leveled the playing field between people who thought they knew
something coming in and the rest. On the other hand it is esoteric and
some find it scary. Back when I created the course with it, MIT was
still using Scheme for their CS1 so that made it an easier sell as did
my reputation in the school.</p>
<p>
That said, I don&#39;t think I could start a new program easily with
Racket and the only place that I know that uses it big time is
Bootstrap World, a program that I&#39;ve mentioned many times before and
like very much. It&#39;s not that it&#39;s bad - you can develop wonderful
courses that use it but rather, there are alternatives that would be
easier to sell to students, parents, and communities.</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-headline-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-2">
Javascript
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
There&#39;s a vocal contingent for JS as a language in both CS1 and CS0. I
like JS a lot. In fact I was using it as much as any other language
until I discovered Clojure and Clojurescript which are now my primary
personal languages.</p>
<p>
JS fans point out that it&#39;s ubiquitous. If you have a browser, you
have a JS interpreter. It&#39;s also the front end language of the web
(although you can transpile other languages like Clojurescript to JS)
and via Node you can run it server side as well.</p>
<p>
Although I love JS, I disagree with this contingent. First and
foremost, JS has a number of, well, let&#39;s say, issues. If you haven&#39;t
seen this video, take a few minutes:
<a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat"><a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat</a></a>.  The JS part starts at
about 1:20 in. JS has also had issues with types. Now admitedly some
of these things have been at least partly addressed like using <code>val</code>
and <code>var</code> but I don&#39;t think this is strictly enforced which is
problematic in a learning language.</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve also found the tooling lacking. If you&#39;re doing front end work
and there&#39;s a problem with your code, if you&#39;re lucky you&#39;ll get some
feedback but sometimes things just won&#39;t run and won&#39;t get a clue.</p>
<p>
Languages like Typescript could address some of these issues but I&#39;m
not familiar enough with Typescript to say.</p>
<p>
A final issue wiht JS is the tooling. Sure, you can just inject some
code in a web page but doing the real deal requires diving into a
crazy complex ecosystem. Grunt, Gulp, Webpack, Parcel, Rollup, Yeoman and
these are just the ones I can come up with off the top of my head and
none of them are trivial to know or to use. Yes, you can kindof just
take a template and use it but to really understand what&#39;s going on?
Not so much.</p>
<p>
So, I&#39;ll take a pass on JS as a CS0 or CS1 language. </p>

<div id="outline-container-headline-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-3">
Ada
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
This is the language that got me thinking about this post. Adacore has
been at SIGCSE every time I&#39;ve attended and they push Ada as a
language. I stopped by to chat with them. Mostly because one of the
Adacore founders, Robert Dewar, who passed away a few years ago, was a
big time mentor to me. I just wanted to chat with the people in the
booth just really to say hi.</p>
<p>
I hadn&#39;t used Ada in decades and probably won&#39;t in the near future but
the Ada I remember could be a very nice language for a CS1 class. </p>
<p>
Ada&#39;s industrial strength but I seem to recall required less magic to
get started than Java. It had all the typing you could want for people
who think that&#39;s important. I also like how it did objects back when I
used it. Ada back then didn&#39;t have inheritence but was what was called
Object Typed as opposed to Object Oriented (I think). You could
essentially use class type constructs for abstraction and to
encapsulate state but it didn&#39;t have inheritance. To me this is
perfect. Inheritance is forced in CS1/CS2 and from what I&#39;ve seen is
really something for tool and library builders and not nearly as  much
for most people doing day to day programming.</p>
<p>
Ada&#39;s also the first, and maybe only language that I was able to
consistently write large complex programs and have them work the first
time. Even with tons of dynamic memory management. This was due to the
language specification and the compiler. </p>
<p>
Are students going to use Ada in the real world? Perhaps though it&#39;s
far more likely that they&#39;ll work in Java, C++, Python or JS but that
doesn&#39;t mean that Ada can&#39;t be a great starting point in CS1 to learn
important concepts and to develop good habits</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-4">
Go
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Next up, Go. One of the downsides of Go is it&#39;s hard to search for
unless you specify golang. Other than that, Ada got me thinking of Go
since I think it shares some traits.</p>
<p>
Go was created to address some of the perceived deficiencies in
C/C++. A small language with a clean design that could still be used
for low level tasks. I haven&#39;t used it much, just some fiddling but I
could see the appeal.</p>
<p>
The language is small and relatively simple so it should be easy to
learn. It also supports objects but no inheritance which is fine by
me. Actually, the object model is pretty different from Java or C++
and I like it a lot. Instead of declaring a Class with variables and
methods you define a struct with variables and associate methods
with it via interfaces.</p>
<p>
Go also encourages consistent code. Python does this with
indentation. Go does it with <code>gofmt</code> a program that takes Go source
code and formats it to the Go standard. Editors can hook into gofmt so
as to call it whenever your program is  saved.</p>
<p>
Go also has a nice model for concurrency but that probably won&#39;t come
up in a CS1 but then again, it&#39;s so clean in Go, it might.</p>
<p>
Two other features are a super fast compiler - yes this can make a
difference and a great set of libraries. A friend of mine once
described Go as a small, clean language with libraries designed by &#34;a
bunch of really smart programmers with good taste.&#34;</p>
<p>
I could think of far worse choices for a CS1 class.</p>
<p>
Interestingly enough, Go was created to replace C/C++ but most of the
adoption has come from the Python world. I personally know a number of
software engineers who ported their products from Python to Go. Maybe
Go could be a sensible alternative to Python as a Java replacement.</p>

<h2 id="headline-5">
Misc Languages 
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
There are few more languages that I want to briefly mention.</p>
<p>
Java not only provides the language but also the Java Virtual Machine
and many languages run on the JVM. These include Scala, Kotlin,
Clojure (my favorite), Groovy and others. I don&#39;t see Clojure as a
great CS1 choice in most cases and don&#39;t know enough about the others
to comment other than they all have some level of interoperability.</p>
<p>
Then, you have languages like Haskel or OCAML but I&#39;m just not going
there.</p>
<p>
Rust is another one to look at. It seems to have all the features but
is a little more imposing to the beginner - at least that&#39;s what I&#39;m
thinking from first glance but I want to dive in more sometime in the
future. </p>
<p>
Finally, a word on Ruby - the other language mentioned in the Wat
video I linked above. Ruby came around a little after Python. Looking
at both I decided I was a Python guy and never really pursued Ruby. It
didn&#39;t talk to me. Years later, Ruby on Rails hit and Ruby
exploded. Ruby and Rails were HUGE and everywhere in the startup
world. Bootcamps in fact started to appear left and right and all
focused on Ruby on Rails.</p>
<p>
A few years later, I started to hear left and right &#34;why don&#39;t you
teach Ruby in high schools.&#34; The answer was, of course &#34;because in a
few years, you&#39;ll be asking why we don&#39;t teach some new thing.&#34;</p>
<p>
Now, a decade later, Ruby has fallen to the wayside and nobody&#39;s
demanding that we teach it in high schools.</p>
<p>
Maybe that&#39;s a cautionary tale. We shouldn&#39;t be teaching something,
particularly in high schol because it&#39;s the hot language or it&#39;s big
in industry. We come back once again to what&#39;s the goal of the
course. What do the students need and what&#39;s the best tool to
accomplish that.</p>
<p>
So, that&#39;s it for this series. I&#39;ll do one more adendum on AP vs non
Ap but it&#39;s been six posts in six days - that&#39;s a lot for me. I
hope it spurs some thought and good discussion.</p>
