Lots of chatter with Donald Trump being kicked off
platforms left and right. On the one hand we&#39;re getting a lot of &#34;it&#39;s
censorship, it&#39;s unust&#34; and on the other side we have &#34;it&#39;s about
time.&#34; I&#39;m of course in the &#34;it&#39;s about time&#34; category but even so,
there&#39;s a cause for concern and a lot of meat for a discussion on tech
policies.</p>
<p>
What makes this interesting discussion fodder is that Trump was
removed from different levels of the internet. First you&#39;ve got actual
applications like Twitter and Facebook. Next you&#39;ve got the Play and
Apple stores and finally, you&#39;ve got AWS which provided cloud services
to Parler. At each level the removal of Trump and others inciting hate
and violence have different ramifications and nuances.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-1">
Facebook and Twitter
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
First let&#39;s look at Facebook and Twitter. On the one hand this is an
easy one. They&#39;re not government agencies - they&#39;re private
companies so the first amendment doesn&#39;t apply. Next, were they
denying service to Trump? No - he had an account on both
services. What did happen is that he violated terms of service. While
I&#39;d never follow Trump, I did follow an account that tweeted his
tweets. The account was set up to see if it would be suspended - guess
what, it was - more than once. This isn&#39;t discrimination or
censorship, this is bouncing the unruly patron at the bar or, dare I
say removing the person who refuses to wear a mask from your store. </p>
<p>
If you&#39;re one of those free market regulation bad people I don&#39;t want
to hear it. In this case, the market did indeed decide. </p>
<p>
There is, however, a big problem and that&#39;s the fact that Twitter,
Facebook and a few other players have so much power. You could argue
they&#39;re de facto monopolies. For years they willingly amiplified
Trump&#39;s lies and now overnight removed him. That&#39;s a huge amount of
power for a company to have. People like me have felt that for years,
Facebook and Twitter have been behaving irresponsibly and as of last
week people on the right feel that way and Dorsey and Zuck can&#39;t be
voted out of office. One can of course argue &#34;The Market&#34; but it&#39;s not
that simple with the market being dominated by a small number of
players. </p>
<p>
I&#39;m doubting that calls to split up the tech giants will be helpful. I
don&#39;t know if we&#39;re better off now as opposed to before AT&amp;T split and
I&#39;m not sure that strongarm regulation is the answer. </p>
<p>
Enforcing open proticols, APIs and standards would probably help a
great deal but in any event, we do have a problem with big tech but
it&#39;s not what the right is crying about now.</p>

<h2 id="headline-2">
The stores and AWS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Next we have the app stores removing Parler. I&#39;m guessing this is also
a violation of TOS issue but there&#39;s another issue here which is
liability. Is Google or Apple liable or responsible for something on
an application they distribute. </p>
<p>
Related but different is AWS - are they responsible for things that
occur on their servers even though it&#39;s Parler or whomever creates and
runs the applications running on the Amazon Cloud?</p>
<p>
Napster enters the chat.</p>
<p>
Not exactly the same, but similar. For you youngsters, Napster was one
of the early file sharing services. It was basically an IRC based
setup to locate mp3 files in order to facilitate their
transfer. Napster never hosted any of the files in question but the
music industry went hard after them. </p>
<p>
Even earlier you had alt.pictures.binaries. Back in the day they said
that people came to the internet for email but stayed for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet</a>
news. Basically, they were forums or chatrooms on just about any
topic. I of course subscribed to comp.lang.c,
alt.sports.basketball.nyknicks and a bunch of others. You connected to
your news server to retrieve and post messages and messages were
transferred periodically between servers. Originally using UUCP which
had computers dialing each other up on set schedules but later over
the internet. The servers didn&#39;t own or even know what was in the
messages. They just stored and forwarded.</p>
<p>
The question came up with binary groups - alt.pictures.binaries in
particular. Groups like alt.pictures.binaries would contain messages
with encoded images. A single image wouldn&#39;t fit into a message and
messages were ascii so binary data couldn&#39;t be directly sent. Images
were encode using a program called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uuencoding">uuencode</a> and split into a bunch of
messages. </p>
<p>
As one might expect, the binary groups ended up a place to traffic
adult and/or illegal material. </p>
<p>
The question was were the server&#39;s owners responsible? They didn&#39;t
create or own the posted material. They probably weren&#39;t even aware it
was on their servers. </p>
<p>
This is a question cloud hosts like AWS have to consider on top of
public perception and just doing what&#39;s right (whatever that is).</p>
<p>
A final note on this is that Net Neutrality, while maybe not applying
in this specific instance harps on the same questions - with net
neutrality, ISPS must treat all network traffic the same. Without it
they are free to do what they want - they could slow down or block
services they don&#39;t want to support. Not the same since cloud servers
are not ISPs but certainly similar. </p>
<p>
Lots of meat here and there&#39;s no clear cut right thing to do. Should
the market decide? Is regulation needed? If so how much. Should it
just be at the application level or how about the cloud? The Net
Neutrality issue isn&#39;t that old but when it came up nobody was talking
about the cloud and app stores as gatekeepers didn&#39;t exist. Add to
that the fact that our elected officials are, let us say, not the most
up on modern tech and tech issues. </p>
<p>
I can see a lot of rich discussion coming out of this.</p>
