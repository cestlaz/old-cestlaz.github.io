My feeds have been inundated with post after post dealing with teacher
burnout, teacher shortages, government attacks on teachers and public
schools. In response to one video, a friend of mine commented:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
Teaching was always a high attrition profession but given the stress
teachers have been under since the pandemic started it&#39;s no surprise
that teachers who can are leaving in droves. As much as society says
that teachers are essential, the fact is that society never puts its
money where its mouth is. Teachers have been underpaid,
under resourced, and overworked for decades.</p>
<p>
The pandemic just brought this out and accelerated it.</p>
<p>
At the same time, young people are realizing that teaching is
becoming less and less viable as a profession. Schools of education
face declining enrollment. It doesn&#39;t help that schools of education
by and large have poor reputations with the public and state
requirements for teaching force those interested to jump through far
too many hoops and the hoops won&#39;t help them if the candidate decides
teaching isn&#39;t for them.</p>
<p>
The fact is that teaching and public school teaching in particular has
been under attack for decades and we might be rapidly approaching a
tipping point.</p>
<p>
This means that if you haven&#39;t, it&#39;s time to pick a side. Are you for
public education and if so, what are you doing about it?</p>
<p>
The right has been attacking public schools for as long as I can
remember. Voucher bills, supporting charters that are terrific ways of
skimming money from public schools while avoiding accountability and
most currently legislation to control schools in ways that, quite
frankly are so vile I won&#39;t dive into specifics here.</p>
<p>
The left isn&#39;t much better. We had Arne Duncan claiming that Hurricane
Katrina was the best thing for New Orleans schools since it allowed
for privatization. Rahm Emanuel has also been no friend to public
education. In NY we had twelve years of Bloomberg who ran as a
republican but aligns with democrats destroying neighborhood schools
and pushing private charters and we also most recently had Andrew
Cuomo who is also no friend to public schools.</p>
<p>
I usually post about CS Education so why am I writing about this?</p>
<p>
Because far too often the CS Community is just happy to be in the game
and ignores the collateral damage to public education.</p>
<p>
I wrote a little about this back in 2017 when Code.org decided to partner with
the College board (<a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cs-ed-in-bed-college-board/">link</a>). Why was a CS Ed organiztion essentially
pushing a new, additional, and worthless standardized exams on to
eighth graders. Now, I&#39;m sure that the people at Code.org don&#39;t agree
with me that the College Board has too much power and is harmful and
this helped them get in the room but I disagree.</p>
<p>
Another great example is when code.org, districts, curriculum
providers and everyone else who&#39;s rolling out short form PD claiming
that &#34;they&#39;ve trained teachers to teach CS&#34; and that those teachers
are ready to go. I&#39;d like to believe all of this is well meaning and I
do believe most of it is but it does real damage to the profession.</p>
<p>
We also see this when we see best practices preached from elite
private institutions. Practices that would never work under urban
public school challenges but that then is what the public school
teacher is held up to.</p>
<p>
We also see this when we work for said institutions or companies who
pay lip service to public education by throwing out some crumbs. Prior
to my pushing things at Google NY, urban public schools weren&#39;t on
their map. They talked the diversity game but didn&#39;t walk the
walk. They&#39;re doing better now but still have so far to go and to be
honest, as an institution I don&#39;t think there&#39; doing better. Rather,
they just have some individuals in places where they can do some good
and they&#39;re doing it. What happens when they leave?</p>
<p>
If you work at one of these big companies or at an &#34;elite&#34; institution
education are you just collecting your check to maintain the status
quo or are you working to make things better in public education -
particularly for the most vulnerable and most undeserved?</p>
<p>
If you are working at said company and are trying to do good, is it
enough?</p>
<p>
No it&#39;s not  and I know that might make some people uncomfortable.</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re working at random big company or &#34;elite&#34; school and run a
program to provide an opportunity for a handful of &#34;those&#34; kids. No,
it&#39;s not enough. My friend Leigh Ann Delyser talks about  <a href="https://csedpodcast.org/blog/season2_episode5/">Systemic
Change</a>. If we just work around the edges, just run our little
programs, in the long run, how much are we changing. If we&#39;re not
working to change the systems we&#39;re just going to remain on the
treadmill.</p>
<p>
One of my jobs at Hunter was to create an honors CS
program. One of the things I insisted on was that I have a chance to
move the opportunities I created to the greater Hunter population. If
I was only affecting my 30 - 60 kids a year nothing was really
changing and when I leave Hunter it would probably be all gone. That&#39;s
not meaningful change. On the other hand, if I can create something
that stick and positively affects all Hunter CS students, then we&#39;ve
moved the needle even if only by a bit,</p>
<p>
I for one left Wall Street over thirty years ago because I found the
work unfulfilling and didn&#39;t believe in the ethics of the system. I
just tried teaching on a lark and it stuck. I went into public
education because I believe in it and its importance and I remain in
public ed to this day. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve succeeded in any systemic
change but I think that I&#39;ve at least been a part of it in my small
corner of the world.</p>
<p>
As many of you know, I&#39;ll talk shop with anyone but I also draw a
line. I&#39;ll talk but I&#39;m not going to work to help you if I think
you&#39;re doing harm. I&#39;ve talked, for instance with people from the
Success Academy charter schools but I&#39;d never work with them, at least
not unless they seriously changed their practices and made amends for
past damage. To quote Carl Fox from Wall Street: &#34;I don&#39;t go to bed
with no whore, and I don&#39;t wake up with no whore. That&#39;s how I live
with myself. What about you?&#34;</p>
<p>
I titled this post &#34;Which side are you on?&#34; That&#39;s from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Which_Side_Are_You_On%3F">song</a> by
Florence Reece about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_County_War">Harlan County War</a> during the labor
movement. Just like then, it&#39;s time to pick sides now. Do you believe
in public education and do you think it&#39;s important and what are you
going to do about it?</p>
<p>
Below is a cover of the song by the Weavers.</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll leave you with one
last story. One of my personal heroes, <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-01-30-pete-seeger/">Pete Seeger</a> was a member of the
Weavers. Pete left the group in 1958. The rest of the group had
decided to do a cigarette ad, something that Pete disagreed with. He
apparently was concerned with both selling out and the health
issues. He left the group although he did fulfill all outstanding
contractual commitments. He relayed the story during an interview. It
went something like: the band said they wanted to do this cigarett
ad. I objected. They said we needed the money. I said &#34;we don&#39;t need
it that much.&#34;</p>
<p>
Something to think about.</p>
