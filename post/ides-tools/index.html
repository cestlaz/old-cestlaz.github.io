Yesterday, Alfred Thompson posted on students <a href="https://blog.acthompson.net/2023/02/cs-studentslearn-your-ide.html">knowing their
development environments</a>. Alfred&#39;s post was inspired by a related post
by <a href="https://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/blog/archives/monthly/2023-02.html">Eugene Wallingford</a>. Eugene&#39;s post was about more than development
environments and both his and Alfred&#39;s posts are worth a read.</p>
<p>
Being a tool wonk I thought I&#39;d add my two cents.</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve always been a tool wonk. Use the right tool for the job and if
you need to buy one, don&#39;t cheap out - get the best value right
tool. This got me in trouble with Devorah when I spent $309 around
thirty years ago at Bridge Kitchenware for a K5SS - 5 quart Kitchenaid
mixer when we were first living together. Back then $309 was a
lot of money for us and to spend on a mixerâ€¦. Over the years, after
countless loaves of bread, cakes and more, the mixer has proven its
worth.</p>
<p>
Likewise my Cuisinart. Nothing fancy, just a motor in a box. Both are
older than our two children. I also love my F Dick 9 inch chefs
knife although that was a bit of a luxury purchase. I also, equally
love my much less expensive Victorinox boning knife.</p>
<p>
Of course, the right tool for me - the home cook, is not necessarily
the right tool for the professional. A restaurant kitchen or butcher
shop is much more likely to have inexpensive Dexter Russel knives
rather than pricey Wusthof ones and they&#39;ll use a regular
sharpening/exchange service. Makes sense - in a restaurant the knives
will be used more frequently by more people who on the one hand, know
how to use the tools better, but on the other might take less
individual care of them.</p>
<p>
Everything that is true about home vs professional tooling can also
inform our CS classroom tooling but it&#39;s not quite as simple.</p>
<p>
True, students should know their tools and know them well but this
should be tempered by what a teacher is trying to do with the class at
any given time. When encouraging students to really learn a
development environment you have to balance the short term benefit,
the long term benefit, and the cost. that cost is usually up front
time. This is also true for professional developers.</p>
<p>
I remember talking to a friend who got a little logic puzzle from a
street fair. It involved rearranging colored lines of blocks. He wanted
to write a program to solve it. So, he started to set up and tweak his
programming environment. He ended up spending so long setting things
up just right that in the meantime, his wife and kids all individually
solved the puzzle by hand.</p>
<p>
One can argue that for future related development, my friend ended up
ahead but since there wouldn&#39;t likely be related development the time
was lost and it would have been much faster just to solve the problem
at hand. </p>
<p>
The other rub is that professional tools can sometimes be too complex
or can do too much for students. I love autocomplete when using
obscure libraries but I don&#39;t think it helps students when they&#39;re
first learning basic language constructs. Same for large provided
template code.</p>
<p>
The thing with IDEs is that you have to find the right one that
supports the way you teach.</p>
<p>
I know teachers that want to do everything on the command line. They
want the students to walk through the process from source code -&gt;
class file -&gt; running on the jvm and the command line gives them that
option. They also might want to teach command line tools. The command
line also, is in some ways the simplest approach. One place to input
commands, one place to see results.</p>
<p>
On the other hand, it can be intimidating and it doesn&#39;t benefit from
all the supports an IDE can give. Personally, I have mixed feelings on this
approach. Sometimes it&#39;s been the right choice for my students, other
times, not so much. </p>
<p>
I know other teachers who love BlueJ - a graphical IDE that focuses
on objects. It really seems to shine in helping to clarify OOP but it
never worked for me. Probably because I&#39;m not a huge OOP fan. That
said, for some teachers it&#39;s the sweet spot IDE.</p>
<p>
Others dump their students into professional IDES like Eclipse or
nowadays VSCode. I feel these give too much and have too much
complexity. Others disagree and that&#39;s fine. What&#39;s right for me and my
students might not be right for another teacher and class.</p>
<p>
For me the sweet spot IDE for new learners are things like DrJava,
DrRacket, or Thonny. Very simple lerning IDEs. They&#39;re not made for
professionals so they don&#39;t integrate with complex build systems. they
give students some structure and support but not too much.</p>
<p>
Most recently, I&#39;ve started students on Thonny for Python then
transitioned them to other tools. I encourage them to do a deep dive
between semesters or over the summer and discover what really works
for them. Through my classes, though, I try to demonstrate how knowing
your tools benefits you as a developer or even just a user. If I can
show how I leverage the Unix shell, I do, if there&#39;s something in
Emacs that makes me more productive, I&#39;ll show it. I&#39;ll also mention
that in most cases, whatever tools they&#39;re using will have an
equivalent and they should explore it.</p>
<p>
While it&#39;s true that a poor craftsman blames his tools, a good
craftsman knows their tools and leverages them to great effect. While
we&#39;re teaching CS, programming, and languages, it&#39;s worth discussing
tooling as well.</p>
