I&#39;ve written about how long it takes to become a <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/post/five-year-class/">master teacher</a> and
that even after 9 or 10 years most teachers are really just advanced
beginners. A big reason for that is our long feedback loop. You do
something and you can&#39;t do it again for a year.</p>
<p>
I was listening to a podcast on my morning run by the Hudson River and
something came up about differences between quantities of items. The difference
between having n versus n+1 of something changes based on the value of n. If, for example, you have 1 versus 2 shoes - that&#39;s a BIG
difference. On the other hand, if you have 100 vs 101 shoes, not so
much.</p>
<p>
This got me thinking about how I framed things when teaching
big-O notation. In big-O you generally just look at the dominant
term. If you have an algorithm that runs in \(O(n^2+n)\) time you
usually just say \(O(n^2)\) because \(n^2\) is the dominant term. If you n
is small, let&#39;s say 2, the difference between 2 and 4 is big so the n
part of \(n^2+n\) seems important but as n gets large, say 10,000, then
the difference between 100,000,000 and 100,010,000 is negligible for
our purposes.</p>
<p>
I try to introduce this concept when teaching big-O but listening to
the podcast and reflecting gave me some thoughts as to how I can do it
better.</p>
<p>
The trouble is, I won&#39;t be able to for a while. I introduced big-O to
our teachers in our summer intensive. My next opportunity to cover the
topic will be sometime this Spring with my first year undergrads. Same
topic, but different audience so it won&#39;t be quite the same. The next
time I get to do this with teachers is next summer. All this supposes
that I remember the changes I&#39;m thinking about making and work them
in. I&#39;m writing myself a few notes but even then, who&#39;s to say if I&#39;m
going to remember the nuance that I&#39;m thinking now?</p>
<p>
That&#39;s the teaching feedback loop - get an idea, try it, and then
can&#39;t iterate for a year. Get a new idea and you can&#39;t try it until
the topics comes up which could be a long time from now.  True, some
things like a new pedagogical trick can be tried out more quickly but
even then you can&#39;t just do it. You&#39;ve got to find where it works
within your current classes and still have to account for the
countless differences that make up your classes when you&#39;re ready for
the next iteration.</p>
<p>
None of this is good or bad, just the nature of our profession. Just
something that I was thinking about this morning.</p>
