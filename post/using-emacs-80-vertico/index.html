In today&#39;s video, we&#39;ll take a look at a few new completion frameworks
for Emacs. For years I&#39;ve been using <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper">Ivy</a> and have been very happy with
it but since I decided to rebuild my Emacs config from scratch I
thought I&#39;d try the new kids on the block, <a href="https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum">Selectrum</a> and <a href="https://github.com/minad/vertico">Vertico</a> along
with some support packages.</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve liked Ivy from day one and still do. To be honest, from a day to day point of
view, I didn&#39;t notice much difference between Ivy and the newcomers
but I do like their philosophies - they&#39;re supposed to be simple and
minimalist and focus on the Emacs completion API without extending
it. You can read about their respective philosophies on their GitHub
pages. Conveniently, both have sections comparing themselves with the
other frameworks.</p>
<p>
For configurations, I just cut and pasted the suggested configs.</p>
<p>
Ultimately I settled on Vertico but both are worth a look.</p>
<p>
The video shows off Vertico but arguably more importantly, it covers
some of the ancillary packages. First, although I don&#39;t show much
about them are Prescient and Orderless - they let you control how your
selections pop up. I&#39;m using Orderless which lets me search for
components by typing partial completions and using spaces to separate
but it lets you do it in any order. What I mean is that if I&#39;m looking
for the command &#34;vertico-mode&#34; I can search by typing something like
&#34;vert mode&#34; which is what I&#39;ve always done, but I can also do the
search for &#34;mo vert&#34; - typing the second part first. That&#39;s pretty
slick.</p>
<p>
Next is Marginalia which brings up extra context information when you
search for things. Things like command descriptions or file modes.</p>
<p>
The third one we look at is Consult which is basically a collection of
useful commands using completions. Basically an answer to Ivy&#39;s
Counsel commands.</p>
<p>
Finally, and this is the show stopper, the video shows Embark. </p>
