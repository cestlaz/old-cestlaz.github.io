<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/17">Day 17</a> brought back Cellular Automata. It was a nice follow up to <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day11/">day
11</a>. In my <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day11/">writeup</a> I talked about data representation - how a Cellular
Automoton like Conway&#39;s game of life is a nice 2D array project in a
class like APCS-A but multi dimensional arrays are only one way to
represent a cellular automaton. Day 17 really drove that home. </p>
<p>
The actual rules were pretty simple - if a cell is active and has 2 or
3 active neighbors it stays active. If it&#39;s inactive and has three
active it becomes active. Otherwise the cell is inactive. </p>
<p>
The catch for part 1 is that this CS is in three dimensions. Each and
a cell&#39;s neighbors are defined as all coordinates that differ by one
in any of the three dimensions. So, if a cell is at an (x,y,z) location
it&#39;s neighbors will be at (x+1,y,z), (x-1,y,z), (x+1,y+1,z),
(x+1,y-1,z), etc. for 26 neighbors in all. </p>
<p>
You could use a list  within a list within a list or a three
dimensional array to represent your world but that&#39;s tricky and error
prone. What&#39;s worse, part 2 took the CA into the fourth dimension.</p>
<p>
Better is to just keep a list or set of active cells. Then the problem
becomes pretty easy. You need to be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find all of a cell&#39;s neighbors - this is pretty easy because you
can iterate over all the +1 and -1 possibilities for each of the x,
y, and z values.</li>
<li>Find all the potential cells for the next state - this is also
pretty easy because it&#39;s the set of all cells that are currently
active along with all of their neighbors. </li>
<li>Count a given cell&#39;s active neighbors - this is easy once you&#39;ve
done the find neighbors routine. </li>
<li>A way to test if a cell is active which is just checking to see if
it&#39;s in your active cells list or set.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then, it&#39;s pretty easy to run the CA: 
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#75715e"># pythonesque pseudocode </span>
potential_cells <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> find_all_neighbors(current_active_cells)
new_cells <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> []
<span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> cell <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> potential_cells: 
  n <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> count_neighbors(cell)
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> is_active(cell) <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> (n<span style="color:#f92672">==</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span> <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> n<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>):
    new_cells<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>append(cell)
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">elif</span> (<span style="color:#f92672">not</span> is_active(cell)) <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> n<span style="color:#f92672">==</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>:
    new_cells<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>append(cell)</code></pre></div></p>
<p>
Then you just have to run generate new states until you get the
answer.</p>
<p>
Part 2 extended the CA to 4 dimensions. If you had a multidimensional
array this would get super message but with a list of active cells,
the changes are minimal - just add an extra coordinate, update getting
the neighbors and you&#39;re good to go.</p>
<p>
This is a case of where thinking through your data representation can
be a big win.</p>
<p>
Clojure code <a href="https://github.com/zamansky/advent2020/blob/main/src/day17.clj">here</a>.</p>

<p>
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/18">Day 18</a> was all about evaluating math expressions. For part 1 you had
parenthesized expressions consisting of numbers * and + that you had
to evaluate but you had to do it by first doing parens then left to
right - multiplication was not a higher precedence.</p>
<p>
This sounds like a parsing first problem but it turns out I was able
to exploit some of Clojure&#39;s language features. Looking at the
subreddit after solving it seems that a bunch of other languages also
have features that could be exploited.</p>
<p>
Clojure represents data (and programs) as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression">S-Expressions</a> - basically
stuff in parens. As a prefix language, instead of writing 10+20, in
Clojure you&#39;d write <code>(+ 10 20)</code>, that is  run the plus function on 10
and 20. If you have something lie <code>(+ 10 (* 20 3))</code>, Clojure has to
evaluate the inner S-Expression (sexp) before it can add that to +10
so Clojure can do the parsing for us. We can take an input string and
convert it to an sexp using <code>read-string</code>  but if we just try to do
<code>(read-string &#34;1 + 2 + 3&#34;)</code> we&#39;d get an error because &#34;1 + 2 + 3&#34;
isn&#39;t a valid sexp so we just surround it by parens:</p>
<p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-clojure" data-lang="clojure">(<span style="color:#66d9ef">def </span>equation-sexp (<span style="color:#a6e22e">read-string</span> (str <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;(&#34;</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;1 + 2 * 3 + (4 * 5 )&#34;</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;)&#34;</span>)))</code></pre></div></p>
<p>
The above would leave us with the sexp (1 + 2 * 3 + (4 * 5 )).</p>
<p>
Next, forgetting the inner parens, we can write a function that will
evaluate an sexp of the form (1 + 2 * 3 + â€¦) etc. Basically, this can
be done with a reduce. Start with the first value then take the rest
of the list two at a time, the first of each pair is an operator and
the second is an operand so apply the operand to the other number in
the pair and your overall result so far.</p>
<p>
In Clojure it looks like this: </p>
<p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-clojure" data-lang="clojure">(<span style="color:#66d9ef">defn </span>part1-eval [f <span style="color:#f92672">&amp;</span> r]
  (reduce (<span style="color:#66d9ef">fn </span>[ans [op next]]
            (apply op [ans next] )) f (<span style="color:#a6e22e">partition</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span> r)))</code></pre></div></p>
<p>
Next, we insert that function name to the start of each sexp so 
(1 + 2 * 3 + (4 * 5*)) becomes (part1-eval 1 + 2 * 3 + (part1-eval 4 *
5)). Finally we can do a  Clojure <strong>eval</strong> on this form which will run
part1-eval on the rest of the sexp which will first run part1-eval on
the 4 * 5, that will return the 20 and then the first part1-eval will
finish it&#39;s calculations to give you the answer. </p>
<p>
Part 2 was similar but there you had to perform addition before
multiplication. All that was necessary was write a part2-eval function
that would stand in for the part1-eval.</p>
<p>
The idea is to take an sexp like (1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5) we first split this
list around the * this gives us (1 + 2) (<strong>) (3 + 4) (</strong>) (5). We then
filter this to remove the non numbers which gives (1 2) () (3 4) (5)
(). Then we remove the empty lists: (1 2) (3 4) (5). Add the elements
of each list: 3 7 5 and then multiply them together.</p>
<p>
All the code is <a href="https://github.com/zamansky/advent2020/blob/main/src/day18.clj">here</a>. </p>
<p>
I like day 17 a lot or some variant for students to discuss data
representations but I think 18 is a little more advanced and probably
wouldn&#39;t touch it in an early CS class - it was fun to work through
though :-). </p>
