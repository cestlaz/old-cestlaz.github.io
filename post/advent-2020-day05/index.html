<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/5">Day five&#39;s problem</a> is a nice one for an early CS class. It can be very
much brute forced but it also touches on some nice concepts and can be
solved pretty elegantly. I&#39;ve embedded a walk through in Clojure at
the end but a Python solution would be pretty similar.  </p>
<p>
Read the problem over if you haven&#39;t. At it&#39;s core you are taking a boarding
pass representing a coded airplane seat number and you&#39;re converting
it to a known seat (row and column). The encoding scheme uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning">binary
space partitioning</a>. The <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/5">question statement</a> goes over the details.</p>
<p>
One of the first things to notice is that you should separate the pass
into two parts - the row, which consists of the first seven characters
each one being an <strong>F</strong> or a <strong>B</strong> and the last three which are the
columns and they are marked with either a <strong>R</strong> or an <strong>L</strong>.</p>
<p>
So, the sample pass <strong>FBFBBFFRLR</strong> separates into <strong>FBFBBFF</strong> for the row
and <strong>RLR</strong> for the clumn.</p>
<p>
There are 128 rows numbered 0 through 127 so you start with 127 (the
back of the plane) and then depending on if the next character is an
<strong>F</strong> or a <strong>B</strong> you either subtract out half the range size or you
don&#39;t. If the character is an <strong>B</strong> you don&#39;t since you&#39;re at the back
of the section and the back rows are higher. If it&#39;s a <strong>F</strong> you do
since you&#39;re at the front and front rows have lower numbers.</p>
<p>
So, the first <strong>F</strong> says you&#39;re at the front so you subtract <strong>half</strong> the
range and now you&#39;re looking at 0-63. The next character is a <strong>B</strong> so
you don&#39;t subtract anything but you&#39;ll be next looking at 32 through
63 etc. The question has a full walk through.</p>
<p>
Looking at the  row string, you have <strong>FBFBBFF</strong>. If we substitute the
amount we subtract for the letters we get <code>64 0 16 0 0 2 1</code> or the
place values of a binary number <strong>in reverse</strong>. </p>
<p>
In my solution, I reversed the string and then converted each <strong>F</strong> or <strong>B</strong>
into a number. A <strong>B</strong> became a 0 and an <strong>F</strong> became 2^i where <strong>i</strong> is the
location (index) in the string. For the sample string, once reversed
to <strong>FFBBFBF</strong> it gives <code>1 2 0 0 16 0 64</code>. If we sum those up and
subtract from 127 we get our row number.</p>
<p>
We basically can do the same thing for the column but there you
subtract from 7.</p>
<p>
Part 1 of the question asks you to map the row and column to a final
number by calcualing <code>row*8+col</code> and then find the highest seat number
from a give list of boarding passes.</p>
<p>
Part 2 requires you look through all the boarding passes to determine
your actual seat - the one seat missing from the data set.</p>
<p>
Lots of good stuff for a class in this question.</p>
<p>
You&#39;ve got the basic data parsing as usual but I love that this can be
brute forced but by noticing the base 2 nature of the data you can
write up a number of different elegant solutions. </p>
<p>
Here&#39;s a complete solution coded up in Clojure. You can also check all
