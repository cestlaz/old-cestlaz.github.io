            <p>
I haven&#39;t been posting about specific CS teaching techniques and
lesson content recently. Probably because I&#39;ve been teaching the same classes
at Hunter now for the past six years.</p>
<p>
Twice a year, Fall and Spring, I teach a recitation for Hunter&#39;s CS1
in C++. In the Fall I also teach a version of their CS0 in Python. My
second undergrad CS class in the Spring is Data Structures.</p>
<p>
I have some freedom in the CS0 class but that&#39;s more with applications
and assignments since the basics are the basics. Data Structures is
even more constrained. I&#39;ve got to cover the same data structures and
algorithms as the other, non honors section. I can do more and I can
cover things the way I want but the list of data structures and
algorithms is pretty set.</p>
<p>
For my CS1 recitation, I probably have the most freedom. For the
regular sections, they cover a number of labs in the recitation. Since
I have an honors class, I push the labs to homework assignments and
can do what I want with the recitation time. This gives me some
freedom but I still have to match the pace and content with what
they&#39;re learning in the CS1 lectures. That means I can&#39;t arbitrarily
cover a topic until it&#39;s prerequisites are covered in the main lecture
and likewise, I can&#39;t cover anything that&#39;s covered in a future
lecture.</p>
<p>
Now, this doesn&#39;t mean I have no freedom at all. For all three
courses, I developed my lessons and I&#39;ve continually tweaked how I&#39;ve
taught but it&#39;s been largely the same.</p>
<p>
I bet this is similar to a math teacher teaching algebra or geometry
for the billionth time.</p>
<p>
For the CS1 lab I initially added in a bunch of software engineering
and a couple of straight CS topics. The software engineering included
things like coding standards, testing, code reviews, working on other
peoples code and the like. It&#39;s worked well but last couple of times
I&#39;ve felt the course was a little stagnant and wanted to mix in some
new things.</p>
<p>
What to add? I looked at the class calendar and lecture syllabus and
as luck will have it, I&#39;ll be able to add three more topics this
semester. First up will be code coverage. We&#39;ve been talking about
testing and TDD since I started teaching at Hunter but code coverage
as it relates to tests has been an afterthought. This time, I&#39;m going
to bring it to the forefront. I think it&#39;ll be interesting and
fun. The second will be Continuous Integration (CI). I was holding off
on this because of tooling but now that I&#39;ve had a chance to look, it
seems that GitHub actions will make it really easy. Finally, I want to
more formally talk about code profiling.</p>
<p>
None of these topics is particularly large or complex (at least at the
introductory level) so it&#39;ll all fit nicely and it&#39;s giving me
something new to get excited about as opposed to the same lessons
merely tweaked. In fact, I&#39;m finding myself thinking &#34;Oh man, I&#39;m
going to have to cover those three lessons on decryption before I get
to that cool new lesson on code coverage, ugh.&#34; Four years ago, the
decryption lesson was the cool and fun new lesson that I was super
excited about.</p>
<p>
So, we&#39;ll see how it all goes. Planning to report back after all the
lessons are delivered.</p>
