Following up on my <a href="/post/what-they-used-to-know/">last post</a>.</p>
<p>
Soon after I read that tweet, I read Julia&#39;s post on <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/09/10/hashmaps-make-things-fast/">hash tables</a>. This
got me thinking more about what is and isn&#39;t taught in school. Hash
tables were always taught in CS programs but back in the day you might
not have used them much after your data structures or algorithms
classes. Nowadays you&#39;re much more likely to use them as they&#39;re built
in to so many platforms.</p>
<p>
Hash tables and related structures are great - I use them all the time
but they can also become a go to without thinking it through. This
actually came up in conversation with the same my high level SE friend
at that big bank from the last post. He also noticed that many interviewees would always
go right to the hash table even when there were red flags in the
question to warn away fro them.</p>
<p>
For a hash table to get you that nice fast expected constant time
performance, it has to be sparse - few collisions. If you implement a
closed hash table (all the data is in a single array) and there&#39;s not
a lot of spare space, it will fill up and all of a sudden that O(1)
insertion and retrieval time will go linear. I can&#39;t say for certain
but I&#39;m guessing the vast majority of Python programmers who use hash
tables (dictionaries) all the time don&#39;t really know this or if they
do never think about it.</p>
<p>
Is this a byproduct of using the built in implementations in college
combined with self taught programmers never seeing this at all? Maybe
but this was probably a deficiency even in my day.</p>
<p>
This also came up when I accidentally interviewed for a position at
Google. There was a question about storing and accessing a bunch of
data. I don&#39;t remember the question but there was a key line - &#34;you
have unlimited storage&#34; which is the trigger phrase for &#34;use a hash
table.&#34; I got a kick out of it but felt this was a you know it or you
don&#39;t. I think I mentioned it to the interviewer.</p>
<p>
This also brought to mind another example. Not mine - I read this in
John Bentley&#39;s terrific book <a href="https://tfetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ProgrammingPearls2nd.pdf">&#34;Programming Pearls.&#34;</a> The gist was that a
room full of very smart people were implementing a binary search. The
idea is that you have an array of data that is sorted and instead of
looking through every item one at a time, you calculate the middle of
the array, look there and then, if you haven&#39;t found the item, you
throw away half the data and repeat the process with the remaining
half.</p>
<p>
Every now and then, the implementations had a problem and nobody could
figure out why. As it turns out, in calculating the midpoint, they&#39;d
add the lower value and the higher value and then divide the sum by
two.</p>
<p>
Sounds reasonable.</p>
<p>
The problem was that when low and high were at the upper end of the
data set the addition would go past the largest integer wrapping
around and causing wonky results.</p>
<p>
Pretty subtle error but at least you&#39;ve got a shot at figuring it out
if you understand integer sizes and how they work on your machine. </p>
<p>
Having some solid low level knowledge won&#39;t prevent this bug from
cropping up but it will give you a fighting chance at fixing it if it
does. </p>
<p>
This particular problem probably won&#39;t come up these days as integers
are MUCH larger than back in the day but I think it illustrates the
point.</p>
<p>
Anyway, just more food for thought on how CS Education has changed
over the years, what we leave in, and what we leave out.</p>
