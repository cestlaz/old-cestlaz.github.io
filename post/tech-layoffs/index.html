Lots of layoffs in big tech recently. Overall lousy but I am
encouraged by the number of people trying to organize the local
community to be supportive in helping those affected.</p>
<p>
Clearly this &#34;correction&#34; can turn current employees worlds upside
down and place individuals and families in precarious financial
situations but the effects also affect the incoming workforce. In
addition to layoffs, internships and offers have been canceled left
and right.</p>
<p>
Things are bad but are they bad enough to convince not only those
directly affected but also those who could be to make things better? I
hope so but I&#39;m skeptical.</p>
<p>
I say those affected rather than the tech industry because I&#39;ve been
thinking a lot about the state of labor recently and changes, just like
during the heyday of the labor movement, changes will only
come when demanded by the masses. </p>
<p>
I get it that when a market contracts, an economy turns down or there
are unforeseen shifts like a global pandemic, money doesn&#39;t flow and
people lose jobs. I get it but that&#39;s not really what I&#39;m seeing.</p>
<p>
I&#39;m seeing left and right that &#34;profits are down.&#34; Read that
carefully. &#34;Profits are Down,&#34; not losses are up. When you say profits
are down, you&#39;re not saying you&#39;re losing money. You&#39;re saying you&#39;re
making money, just not as much. It&#39;s like the Wall Street mindset that
turned me off so many years ago. If you buy a stock, it goes
up, yo sell, you make money. If it then goes up more, the Wall Street
mind thinks you&#39;ve lost money. That&#39;s not healthy.</p>
<p>
If companies were just trimming the fat, that would be one thing but
that wouldn&#39;t result in mass layoffs - that would happen over time
when a hire was found to be a bad fit. Sure. Some non-productive
employees are being let go but so are many really good people. If
a company is letting go of good people then that&#39;s bad planning on the
companies part.</p>
<p>
The truth is that even though tech employees are relatively well
paid, they&#39;re still cogs in the machine and ultimately, at will
employees. Maybe people will start to realize with all the perks
more often than not, they&#39;re still just there to make money for the
corporation. At the end of the day, the company doesn&#39;t care about
them. Even when we see the top execs taking cuts, we don&#39;t see it
affecting their lifestyles. It&#39;s a token gesture to ameliorate the
masses - make them feel like the top of the ladder is feeling the
pain. They&#39;re not. They&#39;ll say &#34;I take responsibility&#34; and then go on
in their bubble.</p>
<p>
Combine the recent corporate welfare (turned frequently into stock
buybacks), the layoffs, price gauging and still profits across
industries and maybe, just maybe, people will start to realize that
we&#39;ve got to get back strengthening the worker. That the hard fought
gains of our parents and grandparents have been given back to the
rich. This goes back as far as I can remember with Reagan firing the
Air Traffic controllers even though their demands were not only
reasonable but in fact just about all are now in affect to Republican
led &#34;Right to work&#34; laws. Of course the Democrats only put up token
resistance if any at all.</p>
<p>
If tech workers, and workers in general, had reasonable rights and
protections. The kinds that, dare I say it, a modern form of union
could provide then when times got bad, the pain would be shared
equally between ownership and worker. Workers wouldn&#39;t be thrown on to
the street willy nilly but there would be a framework to provide a
safety net. </p>
<p>
Will the tech workers community act in any way not only to protect
themselves in the future but other workers in general? We&#39;ll see. As I
said, I&#39;m skeptical but there are some trying. I won&#39;t mention names
but a handful of my former students have been active and vocal in
fighting for workers rights and equity in tech, sometimes at great
personal cost, and I couldn&#39;t be prouder of them. I hope they prevail.</p>
