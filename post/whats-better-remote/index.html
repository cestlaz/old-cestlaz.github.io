With my first classes of the semester coming up on Monday I thought
I&#39;d write a bit about what worked better remote than in person. When I
say better I mean specifically, worked better for me given my
situation. I think they worked better for the class but I can&#39;t say
with any certainty given the length of the educational feedback loop
and other factors.</p>
<p>
My in person teaching situation is as follows. Last semester I taught
2 in person classes (plus one remote). Both were in computer
labs. Minimal distance between the kids. Everyone had to have set
assigned seats and masks had to be on at all times. As the instructor,
I was allowed to remove my mask but I never would.</p>
<p>
So, here we go.</p>

feeling safe
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Big one. Remote felt safer. It doesn&#39;t really matter if it was safer
or not. This is a case of perception being reality. Since I felt less
safe - particularly at the start of the year before the students were
vaccinated, I can say for sure that I wasn&#39;t as effective. If the
students didn&#39;t feel safe I&#39;m sure their learning also took a hit.</p>
<p>
For all the dings on remote teaching, we all felt safe.</p>

participation
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
In my personal opinion, my classes last semester went from what I hope
were good classes to not so good lectures. Since students wore masks
and don&#39;t project their voices in any case, student participation was
really tough. It would turn into asking students to repeat their
answers multiple times and to project louder and louder. It didn&#39;t
help that windows had to be open and we&#39;re in the heard of NYC with
all the associated street noise.</p>
<p>
Now, remote participation is no great shakes. It&#39;s really easy for a
student to just tune out but at least it was possible. Students could
be called on or could volunteer and between the Zoom and our Zulip
chat, there were far more opportunities for students to be involved.</p>
<p>
Now, once we&#39;re safe and mask free, in class will probably be better
than remote for this but for now, I can&#39;t say that it is.</p>

<div id="outline-container-headline-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-3">
Group work
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Group work in person was pretty much impossible. Even though there was
little distancing between the students, they had to stay in their
assigned locations. On Zoom we had breakout rooms and on our Zulip,
group chats. In normal times, in person would blow away remote but
something reasonable on zoom and zulip was far better than nothing in
person.</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-headline-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-4">
Working with individuals / small groups
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I also couldn&#39;t really work well with individual students (or small
groups if we were able to set them up). Online I could do a breakout
visit or an individual or group chat. Again, something being better
than nothing. The one place where in person was better is that, while
it was limited, I could eaves drop on the kids - look over while they
worked. It was limited because I didn&#39;t want to get too close and also
for the reasons cited above but it was something. Can&#39;t do that with
Zoom. Interestingly enough, Big Blue Button - an opensource Zoomalike
does have an eavesdrop on breakout rooms feature as it&#39;s made for
teachers but last I checked the overall platform was not quite ready
for prime time.</p>

<div id="outline-container-headline-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-5">
Polls
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Another big win for remote was the use of the Zulip chat. Emoji polls
replicate the use of a clicker but with more power and flexibility and
less overhead.</p>
<p>
You can also give a question and have them all type a response but
not hit  the <strong>enter</strong> key. The can then all post at once. You can do
similar things with hand signals in class but this is much more
flexible and robust. Big win.

<h2 id="headline-6">
Discussion of student work
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Finally, the chat platform gave us the ability to discuss more
student&#39;s work. Typically, in class you can only look at one or two
student solutions for a given problem but using the chat, you can
stretch out the discussion. A typical strategy is to have  everyone
post their initial answer/response/whatever and then over the course
of time have each student comment on at least two other student
posts. Yes, this has it&#39;s kinks but it&#39;s a nice way to get more
students to look at more other student&#39;s work.</p>

Takeaways
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
At the beginning of last semester, I felt that we should have at least
started online - particularly with the students potentially
unvaccinated. Looking back, I think it would have been better
overall.</p>
<p>
Truthfully, the ideal would have been to do remote until students were
vaccinated then allow professors to mix and match as best suits their
classes.</p>
<p>
If we ever get past this and back to regular old school in person
classes, sure, that beats remote for instruction overall but remote
does have it&#39;s moments. On top of that, good remote can beat crippled
in person and sometimes there are other good reasons for a remote
option such as why I want my teacher prep program to remain online.</p>
<p>
So, there it is. Where I think remote teaching outshone in person for
me over the last year. As a college istructor I have more flexibility
than a K12 teacher so can mix in remote practices that I feel work
better. I&#39;m hoping that over time those that set the K12 structure
would make it similarly possible at that level.</p>
