Devorah and I just got off a Zoom pension consultation. Very
enlightening.</p>
<p>
I&#39;m 54 so regardless, can&#39;t retire for another year but Devorah hit 55
last November and the DOE can really kill ones spirit and grind you down.</p>
<p>
Overall I&#39;ve been pretty happy at Hunter but I&#39;ve written before about
the fact that I&#39;ve been feeling some burn out and have been basically
doing 2+ full time jobs myself at Hunter for the past few years and
that&#39;s just not sustainable.</p>
<p>
Not saying I know what I&#39;m going to do  but it&#39;s important to know
your options.</p>
<p>
I wasn&#39;t sure what our retirement benefits would look like but when I
came in to teaching, looking at the older tier 1 teachers, I felt that
back then there was something of a societal pact, at least in NYC. As
a teacher back then, you weren&#39;t going to get rich. In good times,
you&#39;d do okay - not great but okay. On the other hand, in bad times,
you wouldn&#39;t do terrible. You&#39;d be able to have a decent home and
while you couldn&#39;t jet set you&#39;d be able to vacation reasonably and at
the end of it all, you&#39;d have a comfortable retirement. Again, you
wouldn&#39;t be rich, but you wouldn&#39;t have to worry about making ends
meet either.</p>
<p>
Over the course of my career, I saw that pact erode, even in NY. Young
teachers don&#39;t earn enough for the housing market and the workload and
work pressures have just exploded. For the newest teachers, the
retirement end of the deal has also gotten worse.</p>
<p>
So, what does it look like for us after putting in and paying in for
30 years?</p>
<p>
With 30 years in, it turns out that pension will net me just a few
hundred dollars less than my current net. It&#39;s much closer than I
thought it would be. Devorah doesn&#39;t do quite as well. Her difference
is greater but that&#39;s because she hasn&#39;t crossed the 30 year barrier
yet. If she stays one more year, she will.</p>
<p>
Add to that a substantial TDA and we&#39;re actually in really good
retirement shape.</p>
<p>
A lot of older teachers say they finally &#34;had&#34; to retire because based
on tax benefits and other factors, they were actually losing money by
not retiring.</p>
<p>
Based on the differences I mentioned above we&#39;re not there yet but
when you factor our housing, we might be, or if not it&#39;s really
close. We currently live in what&#39;s known as a &#34;limited equity coop.&#34;
It&#39;s a coop but it receives local and state tax benefits. In return,
there are earning caps on the residents. We currently earn well over
the cap so pay a significant surcharge on our monthly maintenance.</p>
<p>
When we retire, our lower incomes will result in a much lower
surcharge or maybe it will remove the surcharge entirely - we&#39;re
working on figuring that out.</p>
<p>
Depending on how that plays out we might actually be losing money if
we don&#39;t retire.</p>
<p>
We&#39;ll have to see.</p>
<p>
As I said at the top. I&#39;m basically happy at Hunter and I think I&#39;ve
accomplished a lot so I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m out the door as soon as I can
walk. We&#39;ve got to lower my workload but they&#39;ve known that for a
while so hopefully are working to solve the problem. Devorah and I
also have to figure out what we want to do in our next phase. I do
know that regardless, I think I&#39;ve still got something to give in the
CS Ed space.</p>
<p>
For any young teachers out there - make sure to max out on that
TDA. It seems like nothing at first but when you look back after 20 or
30 years it&#39;ll surprise you - that + the defined pension are what
allow you to have a few years of leisure at the end of a life of
service. And don&#39;t let anyone tell you that you don&#39;t deserve it or
that it&#39;s an entitlement. You&#39;ve paid into it for your whole career
and are just getting back what you&#39;ve earned.</p>
