Today was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton">Cellular Automaton</a> Day at Advent of Code. You have a world
that&#39;s usually represented as a grid of cells. Each cell can be in a
certain state. Given a certain state, the next state is determined by
simple rules like for a given cell how many of it&#39;s neighbors are the
same color. 
</p>
<p>
The most popular Cellular Automat is probably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway&#39;s Game of Life</a>
where each cell can be either alive or dead in a given generation and
in the next generation the state will be determined by how many of its
neighbors are currently dead or alive. 
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve always liked teaching with Celluar Automata and explored it
deeply in the intro course I designed at Stuy. NetLogo is perfect for
representing a CA (<a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-01-15-shift-image/">old post</a>) and we even do things like using a CS to
<a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-01-17-maze-ca/">solve a maze</a>. Good stuff.
</p>
<p>
Today&#39;s problem set up a CA where each cell can be one of three
states - floor, occupied chair, unoccupied chair. The floor never
changed but the chairs can change from occupied to unoccupied and back
based on neighbors. I actually really like teh question. It&#39;s posed as
passengers prefer to sit in s eats next to other empty seats which is
true and the overall problem is much more realistic and therefor
accessible than Conway&#39;s game of life. I think I might lead with it if
I do CA again with my students. 
</p>
<p>
You can find my Clojure solutions <a href="https://github.com/zamansky/advent2020/blob/main/src/day11.clj">here</a>. They were pretty
straightforward. I spend too much time going down the &#34;learn how to
write a lazy sequence in Clojure&#34; rabbit hole for part 2 before just
writing it in a more traditional way.
</p>
<p>
To me there are a couple of interesting things at play when teaching
CA. The first is state management and synchronization. When beginners
work on a CA they frequently look at a cell, figure out it&#39;s next
generation value and then replace the cell with its new value. Then,
later they look at a neighboring cell and when that cell looks at its
neighbors it gets the changed value not the original one. Clearly a
problem. 
</p>
<p>
Writing a CA makes it clear that you have to keep your state clean
while you build a new state for the next generation. That&#39;s an
important lesson to learn.
</p>
<p>
The other interesting teaching point is with data representation. CA
is frequently taught as a 2D array exercise. This makes sense -
simulations like Conway&#39;s Game of Life work perfectly in a 2D array
and if you&#39;re doing graphics with your class you can also get cool
animations through the generations. 
</p>
<p>
That said, there are other valid representations that could be
superior at times. You might have a list of living cells or a hash
tabe of cells if you have more than 2 living states. This can be far
superior from a space efficiency point of view if you don&#39;t have a lot
of living cells compared with your world size - say you have a CA with
a theoretically unlimited size. 
</p>
<p>
So, there it is - thoughts on today&#39;s problem. As I said, it was
pretty straightforward but I also really like the setup and will
probably use it in class at some point in the future.
