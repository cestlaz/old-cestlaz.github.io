            <p>
I know, where&#39;s day 9? Thursdays (and Mondays) are already tight for
me - I teach all morning and it&#39;s been a rough week. I just had very
little energy and focus all day yesterday. I snuck some time in to
finish part 1 but couldn&#39;t focus on part 2.</p>
<p>
Today, however, my body gave me an extra half hour of sleep (til
4:30am) so I had extra time and energy. I was fortunate in that
today&#39;s problem was essentially one that I&#39;ve assigned time and time
again so I was able to wrap it up quickly and then go back to finish
day 9.</p>
<p>
It&#39;s pretty likely that there&#39;ll be a day I can&#39;t solve in the near
future so maybe I&#39;ll write up day 9 then.</p>
<p>
But for now, <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/10">day 10 - Syntax Scoring</a> or as I like to say a bracket
bonanza. Inputs were lines of brackets like this:</p>
<pre class="example">
[({(&lt;(())[]&gt;[[{[]{&lt;()&lt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Both parts of the problem involve figuring out if the line is valid,
that is, if each open bracket has a matching close bracket without
overlap. For example (([])) is valid but (([)]) is not becaue the
inner () and the [] overlap.</p>
<p>
I could be like a kid doing a technical interview and pretend I hadn&#39;t
solved the problem before the interview but the truth is, I&#39;ve
done problems very similar to this most times I teach data structures.</p>
<p>
As you process through the input, whenever you see a closing bracket,
it <strong>has</strong> to match up with the last seen open bracket otherwise the
expression is invalid. This means you have to maintain a data
structure in such a way that the last open bracket you see is the
first one you check whenever you see a closing brace.</p>
<p>
This is, by definition, a stack. A stack is a data structure where the
last item you put in is the first item you take out.</p>
<p>
So, the algorithm is pretty simple.</p>
<div class="src src-text">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">make an empty stack
For each character in the input:
  1. If it&#39;s an open bracket put it on the stack
  2. If it&#39;s a close bracket, check the top of the stack.
     1. If the stack is empty you&#39;ve got an invalid expression - exit
     2. If top of the stack doesn&#39;t match your bracket - invalid -exit
     3. If top of the stack does match your braket, pop it off the stack and keep going</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
That&#39;s basically it. The only remaining task is to figure out the
specifics to answer the problem.</p>
<p>
For part 1 you had to run the above algorithm on each line of input
and for each invalid expression look up the invalid character&#39;s value
(provide in the problem text) and add them all up.</p>
<p>
For part two you had to take the remaining characters in the lines
once you hit an invalid brace and figure out a slightly more complex
score.</p>
<p>
So, given that I had basically done this problem it wasn&#39;t hard but it
was fun. This could be directly assigned to any data structures class.</p>
