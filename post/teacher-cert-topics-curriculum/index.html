I&#39;ve frequently been asked for curricula. I&#39;ll hear from a school or
someone otherwise involved in a school or education and they&#39;ll ask
for a course they can drop in and teach.
</p>
<p>
I explain it doesn&#39;t work that way. A syllabus or curriculum is only
so good. A great curriculum with a bad teacher will still be bad but a
great teacher can do a lot to salvage a horrible curriculum.
</p>
<p>
A curriculum only goes so far. At it&#39;s most sparse, it&#39;s a list of
topics. At the other end we frequently see worked out prescribed
lessons that can be a boon to a beginner but in the end constrains
great teachers. 
</p>
<p>
As a side note, this was something I noticed years ago when touring
elementary schools for my own children. We saw one school where
everything was in lockstep - every classroom looked basically the
same. Every teacher taught the same subject at the same time as every
other teacher each day and what they taught and how they taught it was
tightly controlled. We opted for  a school where the teachers were
much more free to actually teach. The school in question was well
regarded and the more we dug in the more we realized that the
strictness the principal imposed helped bring the bad teachers up to a
certain level and got most students through the standardized tests but
there was no joy. Great teachers weren&#39;t allowed to teach. It was a
perfect example of a Bloomberg era stat mill. 
</p>
<p>
Anyway back to CS.
</p>
<p>
I was thinking about this while we watched the summer cohort&#39;s topic
presentations. Three of the topics were ones that I teach annually -
AI Search, NLP, and Cipher decryption. Some of the others I&#39;m planning
on mixing in next year. The presentations and supporting materials
were all terrific but in every case, the teachers chose to spin and
emphasize aspects different to those I would emphasize.
</p>
<p>
In the case of the cipher decryption lesson, the cohort emphasized the
machine learning type aspect. I spin the lesson more towards a
recommender system. Neither is better or worse. My guess is that we
each selected aspects that were exciting to us and riffed on
those. Similarly the other groups brought up nuances and emphases that
differed from mine. 
</p>
<p>
It was terrific.
</p>
<p>
If you look at a syllabus, the search topic might just say &#34;Depth
First Search.&#34; It might be in the recursion section of the class and
thus lead you to teaching a recursive solution or it might be in
the data structure / stack section and lead you to implement your own
stack. If the curriculum is fleshed out it&#39;ll give more specifics but
will it talk about states and state space? How about implicit data
structures? 
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s so much richness to a well taught course that&#39;s never captured
by a curriculum and that includes tangents, side stories and limitless
discoveries. 
</p>
<p>
When I talk to my students decades later it&#39;s usually not those lines
on the syllabus they remember but the richness that lives in the ether
of a well taught class.
</p>
<p>
So cool that our certification program created an environment where
we&#39;ve been able to mix the spices from so many different chefs and
each of us is leaving with something new and richer.
