Today is the start of CSTA&#39;s annual conference. Like last year, it&#39;s
virtual. Unlike the past few years, this year I won&#39;t be attending.</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a big fan of the CSTA conference. <a href="https://twitter.com/jakebask">Jake</a> and team have done an
amazing job growing the conference and it&#39;s been a highlight of my
year every time I&#39;ve attended.</p>
<p>
I could say that I&#39;m not attending due to my schedule - I&#39;m pretty
much spending all day every day during July teaching in my CS Teacher
Certification program and at the end of the day I&#39;m wiped. This is
true but it&#39;s not the only reason. The truth is, I&#39;m pretty burned
out. Part of it is doing too many things. At this point, the
teacher education part of my portfolio is a full time job as is my
work with the undergraduate CS students and that&#39;s not counting the
extras that have worked their way onto my plate. The other part of it
I&#39;m sure is Covid. I&#39;m writing this because  many teachers are
overworked and add in this past year of Covid and I&#39;m sure many are
feeling the same as I am.</p>
<p>
I love the CSTA conference but I&#39;m just not feeling it. Same with a
lot of professional stuff - just not feeling the joy these days.</p>
<p>
I&#39;m hoping that come August I can turn everything off for a few weeks
and recharge a bit for next year and going back in person (safely)
will provide a boost.</p>
<p>
I&#39;m betting teachers around the country are feeling rather burned out
so wanted to share publicly saying you&#39;re not alone, it&#39;s okay and
it&#39;s okay to dial it back for our own mental and physical well being. </p>
<p>
Already looking forward to a better next year and  CSTA2022, hopefully in person.</p>
