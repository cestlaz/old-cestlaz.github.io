Yesterday I read three posts on teaching recursion. <a href="https://parentheticallyspeaking.org/articles/how-not-to-teach-recursion/">First</a> by Shriram
Krishnamurthi discussing his thoughts on how recursion is taught
incorrectly. This prompted Adam Michlin to <a href="https://blog.ceos.io/2021/01/02/why-you-shouldnt-teach-recursion-yet/">write about</a> teaching
recursion later with some commentary on APCS and then finally, Alfred
Thompson added <a href="https://blog.acthompson.net/2021/01/recursionhow-and-when-to-teach.html">his thoughts</a>. </p>
<p>
Much like everything else in education there is no single right way to
do things. To say as an absolute that you should or shouldn&#39;t teach in
a certain way is wrong - too many variable.s In my experience you can
teach recursion early or late but the structure of your program and
your choice of tools can influence how successful you&#39;ll be. If you&#39;re
teaching a programming course in a language like Python or Java and
are teaching control structures first you&#39;re going to have a hard time
doing recursion early. They&#39;ll get looping structures before they know
the constructs that support recursion - either for control or for
representing data. On the other hand, if you teach objects first you
might have more success.</p>
<p>
On the other hand, if you&#39;re using a language like Scheme where lists
and recursion are right in the forefront you&#39;ll likely have more
success with recursion early rather than late. I wrote a bit about
this <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/recursion-early/">a couple of years ago</a>. </p>
<p>
I&#39;ll leave the &#34;how important is recursion&#34; question for annother time
but I want to address one more thing here. In yesterday&#39;s posts four
traditional recursion problems received a solid bashing and I don&#39;t
think it was fair. As I said up top, <del>only a Sith deals in absolutes</del>
in teaching, there are no absolutes. Is factorial a wonderful
motivation for recursion - particularly for a student who knows loops?
Probably not but can it have some value? Let&#39;s see…</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-1">
Factorial
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
While this might not be a terrific motivator it does have some
niceties. Most students will know factorial but will only be able
describe it informally - &#34;multiply all the numbers between 1 and n.&#34;
The recursive definition is more, precise, for lack of a better word.</p>
<p>
Then, there&#39;s a direct translation between the recursive definition
and the code. </p>
<p>
Finally, it&#39;s about as bare bones as you get - no data structures or
undue complexity. </p>
<p>
Is this going to motivate a student to learn recursion? No.</p>
<p>
Can it be used to help paint a more complete picture? Probably.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-2">
Fibonacci 
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Also got a bad rap in the above linked posts. It shares the benefit of
the recursive definition directly translating to a coded solution with
factorial. </p>
<p>
Fibonacci is also a problem where they originally learned it via the
recurssive rule &#34;the next Fibonacci number is the sum of the two
previous fibonacci numbers.&#34;</p>
<p>
It also seems that when students find the Fibonacci number problem
challenging to solve as beginners without recursion. The whole a
becomes b. b becomes c thing can be tricky for beginners. In  my
experience, they find the recursive solution to be more natural. This
is also interesting because they usually don&#39;t find recursive
factorial more natural than a loop (assuming they learned loops
first).</p>
<p>
Next, the slowness of the solution is feature, not a bug. It&#39;s a
platform to talk about how recursion isn&#39;t always the answer but you
can think about a problem recursively and if the solution isn&#39;t right
it might lead you to a better solution. This comes up later with
dynamic programming. Just last year (he he) during Advent of Code I
ended up solving one of the problems via dynamic programming. How did
I get there? Thinking about the problem recursively. </p>
<p>
Here you get a great platform for now comparing solutions - iterative,
recursive, tail recursive, memoization - take it as far as you want.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-3">
Euclid&#39;s algorithm 
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
I can&#39;t comment on Euclid&#39;s algorithm since I can&#39;t recall ever
teaching it as part of recursion so I&#39;ll substitute Newton&#39;s method
for square root approximation. </p>
<p>
The thing is that here, the goal isn&#39;t really recursion. It&#39;s just a
problem that can be tackled with either recursion or iteration. The
reason it&#39;s a neat problem is because you can talk about floating
point accuracy issues along with how close of an approximation you
might want or need. </p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-4">
Towers of Hanoi
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Finally we get the Towers of Hanoi. Sure it&#39;s contrived but it can
also be fun and by being a new and different problem students can try
to use any strategies that might lead to a solution, recursive or
otherwise:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>try some small examples</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>see if examples relate to each other</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>base case?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The big deal though is that Towers of Hanoi isn&#39;t really about Towers
of Hanoi - it&#39;s really a platform to talk about all sorts of good
stuff. I wrote all about it <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2010-01-10-towers-of-hanoi/">a decade ago</a>. </p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-5">
Other stuff
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Now, of course you can introduce recursion in other ways particularly
if you use a language like Scheme. </p>
<p>
Bottom line is that without taking into considerations lots of other
factors - student backgrounds, teacher comfort. Time, experience,
facilities, goals and desired aoutcomes, and more you can&#39;t really say
one way is right or one way is wrong.</p>
