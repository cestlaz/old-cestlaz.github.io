<p>
It&#39;s been a long year since March. Many of us have not really been
able to leave NYC for a variety of reasons - financial, professional,
or family to name a few.</p>
<p>
Other than a couple of small escapes in the last two weeks we&#39;ve been
home and working from home in our Manhattan apartment since this all
started. Early on we didn&#39;t get out much and we still aren&#39;t and that
does take its toll. You have to go out to shop but walking the same
streets over and over is a bit monotonous and far too few people seem
to understand that for masks to be helpful they have to cover both the
mouth and nose. Since recovering I do get out for a run most mornings
and that helps.</p>
<p>
I realized that one of the draining factors of being stuck in a NYC
apartment is that everything I was doing was on screens. I teach via
the computer and consume my news and communicate the same way. If I&#39;m
working on a side programming project that&#39;s more computer time as
well. If I watch some TV I&#39;m just switching out one screen for
another. Even when I read which I&#39;ve been doing much more of since the
outbreak it&#39;s still on a screen!!!!!</p>
<p>
Devorah doesn&#39;t have this problem - between her knitting, spinning,
and weaving she&#39;s got plenty of non-screen time. She always said I
needed a hobby and as usual, was probably right.</p>
<p>
How about painting. </p>
<img width="50%" src="/img/bobross/halloween.jpg">
<p>
Years ago, 1997 or 1998 I did Bob Ross for Halloween. It was an
absolute blast. I did a painting in each class and a couple by the
second floor bar. So much fun but I didn&#39;t really know how to paint. I
watched the show a few times but that was it.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
I never really did anything after that Halloween - oil paints are
messy, take forever to try, are hard to clean, and require the use of
hazardous solvents. I put the stuff away in a closet.</p>
<p>
Fast forward to today - we have water mixable oils which remove the
toxicity issued and makes clean up easier and there&#39;s now a wealth of online
resources to learn from. I thought I&#39;d give it another go.</p>
<p>
Even with just a little practice, I&#39;m starting to get better.</p>
<img width="50%" src="/img/bobross/mountains.jpg">
<p>
And while it&#39;s all a work in progress,</p>
<img width="50%" src="/img/bobross/islands1.jpg">
<img width="50%" src="/img/bobross/islands2.jpg">
<p>
But it&#39;s been fun.</p>
<img width="75%" src="/img/bobross/trees.jpg">
<p>
Each time I paint it&#39;s getting me away from a computer screen for an
hour or two and it&#39;s been both relaxing and fun. The only downside is
that they still take forever to dry.</p>
