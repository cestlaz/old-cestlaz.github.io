Since entering end of term grades I&#39;ve finally had a few days of legit
down time. It&#39;s been a long time. In the past few years, I went right
from Fall finals int dealing with whatever issues arose around
planning the next teacher ed cohort.</p>
<p>
Not so this year. The three classes I&#39;m teaching are the same as last
year so while I&#39;ll be doing a lot of tweaking, planning, and updating
once we get started, there&#39;s not much to do now. For the teacher ed
cohort, I&#39;m advocating starting our next one in the Fall so again,
nothing to do for a while.</p>
<p>
So, what have I been doing with this newly freed time? One thing I&#39;ve
gotten to do is a bit more painting - something I decided to pick up
during the pandemic - something to get me off computer screens for a
while. I&#39;m just a beginner but I&#39;m enjoying it and making progress.</p>

<p>
Another thing I&#39;ve been doing is getting back to some
programming. Nothing huge but it&#39;s something I haven&#39;t done in a
while. Last December (2021) I did a few <a href="http://adventofode.com">Advent of Code</a> problems -
basically the easier ones at the start of the month that I could knock
out quickly. I stopped when the end of semester crush got bad. Same
thing this year. In between, I didn&#39;t write a line of code. That&#39;s not
entirely true - I wrote some small snippets for my classes but I don&#39;t
really count that sinces it was all variations on things I&#39;ve written
a hundred times already.</p>
<p>
Since the semester ended, I&#39;ve been able to go back and finish off a
couple of &#34;harder&#34; problems and also dive in to a couple of of other
small projects. One, a tool to automate some GitHub work and another a
Slack bot to make emoji polls. This got me back to dealing with web
code, working through OAuth and a few more little things. I did all of
that in Clojure but also got back to playing a bit with Rust.</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s absolutely necessary for CS teachers to write
programs in their spare time but for many CS teachers, and certainly
for me, there are a lot of benefits. On the practical side, it helps
me keep up with current technologies. When I started teaching, there
was no web. Then HTML. Soon after Perl was king along with CGI. Later,
Javascript brought us Ajax. Fast forward and we&#39;re using things like
React. All very different technologies and all require different
approaches. Even if I&#39;m not teaching web development, keeping current
also keeps me current in good development practices, architecting
projects and other aspects of coding through which I can help my
students.</p>
<p>
If I&#39;m exploring with contest problems like Advent of Code, I&#39;ll learn
new algorithms and experiment with data structures - also something
that helps me as a teacher.</p>
<p>
Of course these are pretty obvious and on the surface. Another HUGE
benefit is it helps place me in to the students mindset. When working
on new projects, one has to find resources and information on the
web. Learn new libraries, tools, and techniques, and of course
DEBUGGING!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
Since I&#39;m retiring from Hunter at the end of the Spring, I fully
expect to continue to be able to dedicate some time to
programming. After all, even though I plan to work to help transition
Hunter to the next guy I expect that to be less taxing than if I were
to continue to be the guy.</p>
<p>
Programming, reading, and other personal professional development is
really important to teachers. I lost that time over the past couple of
years, but prior, at Hunter I had it. The real shame is that K12
teachers are rarely given the time and I think their students are worse
off as a result.</p>
