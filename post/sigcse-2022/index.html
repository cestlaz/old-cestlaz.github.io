Tomorrow I&#39;ll be driving up to Providence Rhode Island for SIGSE 2022,
basically the largest computer science education conference out
there. I guess ITSE, a conference I&#39;ve never attended, is larger but
that&#39;s really EdTech with some CS.</p>
<p>
The last in person conference I went to was two almost exactly two
years ago - also SIGCSE. I arrived in Portland and went to a
pre-conference session and on the morning of the big start, about three
hours before I ran my session, I saw an email saying we were
canceled. I flew home and a few days later we began our shelter in for
covid.</p>
<p>
In spite of the latest CDC release, SIGCSE is still requiring
masks. This is something I support. I have no problem taking a
conservative view on health, particularly at an event that brings
together people from all over the world.</p>
<p>
The sessions should be comfortable. Everybody will be vaccinated and
should be masked so it&#39;s no different than attending a concert in
NYC. I am curious though about the lunches and big reception. Will
everyone just dump the masks for food since we&#39;re all vaccinated? Will
there be some trepidation? We&#39;ll see.</p>
<p>
I&#39;m also curious to see the overall attendance. The last SIGCSE had
well over 1,500 attendees. What will this one be like? </p>
<p>
There are some sessions I&#39;m really looking forward to. There are some
on K12 teacher preparation and professional development. I feel pretty
confident that the approach I&#39;m taking at Hunter is the right one but
it&#39;s always good to see what other people are thinking about and
trying - always happy to steal better ideas. I&#39;m also looking forward
to some of the sessions that deal with teaching more advanced CS
concepts. This is something that&#39;s lacking in CS Ed. The CSTA
conference which focuses on K12 is more about actual teaching but
since K12 CS is still in its infancy, most schools are still dealing
with intro level stuff and conferences like CSTA really have to work
to support our new teachers.</p>
<p>
Most importantly though, I&#39;m looking forward to seeing people that I
haven&#39;t seen in a couple of years. Both those that I consider real
friends and also the many acquaintances I&#39;m friendly with.</p>
<p>
I&#39;m also looking to see the breakdown of K12 and higher ed
people. Over the years the number of K12 teachers at the conference
has grown and it&#39;s interesting to see the differences in the
camps. The teachers, by and large know far less CS but are much
stronger teachers while the professors know the topic but while they
might research teaching, they don&#39;t nearly have the depth of teaching
knowlege that K12 teachers posess.</p>
<p>
This is a probably unfair oversimplification but you could say that teachers teach
the student and professors teach the subject.</p>
<p>
This can make for an interesting dynamic. I hope over time, the
teachers become stronger in the subject material and that the
professors realize that teaching is an art and a craft and that what
one does at an elite institution is worlds away from the inner city
middle school.</p>
<p>
Anyway, enough yammering. For those of you who&#39;ll be in providence
this week, make sure to say hi. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll all learn a lot and have
a blast doing it.</p>
