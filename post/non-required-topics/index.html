<p>
This reminded  me of the recent article and
discussion on how students <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/students-dont-know-what-files-and-folders-are-professors-say/">don&#39;t know what files and folders are</a>. </p>
<p>
Neither of these are surprising. Back in the day, computer science
classes were populated with self selecting stereotypes and in order to
get anything done you had to be familiar with your tools.</p>
<p>
I wrote about this <a href="/posts/2015-01-15-kids-know-nuttin/">years ago</a>. </p>
<p>
Nowadays, CS is trying to be more open and inviting and with more
modern tools you no longer need to know about files
and folders let alone a Unix command line.  Back in the day, even if
you used a program like Microsoft Word you&#39;d have some idea of a file
folder structure but now with the cloud and tools like Google Docs you
just search for your documents.</p>
<p>
The issue is that many CS teachers want students to know the command
line but it&#39;s not part of the formal curriculum. What&#39;s more, the
value of command line expertise is debatable and pretty hard to assess.</p>
<p>
Personally, I&#39;m a big command line wonk. I think you gain tremendous
power and flexibility if you use it but I also recognize that there
are many career tech professionals, particularly these days that will
never use it and arguably won&#39;t really benefit from it. They live in
their IDE that supports their language. It integrates with their
build, test, and debugging tools and their company&#39;s commuication
platform is also right there on the side. Now, many people in tech
could still benefit from command line expertise but try convincing a
first or second year undergrad where they not only don&#39;t see added
value but also see that a large chunk of the text world also doesn&#39;t
see the value.</p>
<p>
So, if you do believe that the command line is important and want
students to learn it, how do you do it?</p>
<p>
There are plenty of tutorials, videos and other learning material
including clever games like <a href="https://gitlab.com/slackermedia/bashcrawl">bashcrawl</a> and I guess you could &#34;force&#34;
students to use the command line while in the classroom but nothing&#39;s
going to stop them from using the file browser tool or an installed
IDE. Even if you severely limit the tools in lab machines, you have no
control over what they use at home and while the command line might be
more powerful, it&#39;s not nearly as learner friendly.</p>
<p>
Then there&#39;s assessment. How do you do that? You could give
memorization type questions on exams but that&#39;s a really bad
idea. Since the command line is process not product, this is a tough
nut to crack.</p>
<p>
To be honest, I&#39;ve struggled with this year after year and don&#39;t have
a great solution. I try to encourage the command line and model how it
can be useful as much as I can but I know I&#39;m only reaching a minority
of my students. In the end, I don&#39;t really care if any of them
ultimately become hardcore CLI users but I really do want all of them
to gain enough exposure so that they can make an informed decision as
to its value and then make up their own minds.</p>
