So, tomorrow, October 19, is my birthday. The big 5 4. Okay, maybe it&#39;s not a
traditionally big one. It doesn&#39;t end in a zero or a five but I think
it rates.</p>
<p>
Why? Because it&#39;s one shy of 55.</p>
<p>
That&#39;s the magic age when I can retire collect my pension should I
choose to do so. It&#39;s what you get when start young and put in over
30 years of service.</p>
<p>
Will I?</p>
<p>
A few years ago I would have given an emphatic &#34;no.&#34; Now, I&#39;m starting
to think &#34;maybe.&#34; I&#39;ve written a few times here about feeling some
burnout and a lot less joy. Part of that&#39;s covid and part of it&#39;s doing
more than two full time jobs. Another factor is that by summer 2023,
actually, summer 2022, I&#39;ll have pretty much accomplished everything
I&#39;ve set out to do here. On top of this, Devorah will be able to
retire before I can so that also weighs in.</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t get me wrong. There&#39;s a lot I like about Hunter and a lot I
still enjoy about my job but there&#39;s stuff that&#39;s just wearing me
down.</p>
<p>
Regardless of what happens, I plan to stay in the game in some
capacity. I want to figure out a situation where Devorah and I can
travel more - my one big regret, but I think I&#39;ve still got something
to contribute to the CS Ed world.</p>
<p>
If we can trim down my workload at Hunter and eliminate the things that
stress me out, I could be there a long time. If not, well, we&#39;ll see.</p>
<p>
For the time being, I&#39;ll enjoy tomorrow. Nothing particularly
special - normal work day followed by a family dinner. Actually,
whole family dinner is always special, just not unusual for us.</p>
