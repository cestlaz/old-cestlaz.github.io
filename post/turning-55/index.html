So, I turned 55 today. Another year older. The changes? Well, I&#39;m
seeing more doctors and seeing them more frequently and to be honest,
I&#39;d love to have a day or two without some small niggling ache or pain
but that&#39;s life. Like many people my age, we&#39;ve got our health issues
but I&#39;m pretty active and managing mine (hey, I had a great 8 mile run
this morning :-) ).</p>
<p>
Still, 55 is a big one. Yeah, I know, it&#39;s not 50 which ends in a 0
and is half a century so people seem to earmark it. It&#39;s also not 62
or 67 when social security can kick in for most people. Nope. It&#39;s
also not 65 when you get all those senior discounts.</p>
<p>
Fifty five, for teachers who started around when I did is that magic
age that, if you&#39;ve put in enough years (which I have) you can retire
and start collecting unreduced pension benefits. </p>
<p>
I mentioned <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/post/turning-54/">last year</a> that I was starting to think about retirement as
a possibility. Of course, that doesn&#39;t mean getting out of the game
entirely but if I go that route it means reducing my work obligations
be they at Hunter or elsewhere. Regardless of what I do, I think I
still have something to offer in terms of CS, the Tech Industry,
Education, and the intersection of the three.</p>
<p>
Regardless of what I decide to do, it&#39;s been a tough few years, and
I&#39;m feeling somewhat burnt out and it&#39;s calming and relieving to know
that if I wanted to, I could now step back whenever it suits me.</p>
<p>
So, now to do some hard thinking and have conversations about this
with family and friends (yes, dear reader, I&#39;ll be reaching out to
some of you) while I work to make the experiences of my current
students as positive and rewarding as I can.</p>
