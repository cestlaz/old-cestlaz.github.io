Time for some final thoughts on <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code 2020</a>. </p>
<p>
This was my sixth Advent of Code but the first time I completed all 25
days. Better than last year&#39;s 31 and a whole lot better than my
weakest effort of 11 stars in 2017. I managed to find the time to
finish all but two on the day they were released and finished those
two on Christmas morning. This was also the first year I wrote all my
solutions in Clojure and I also made a bunch of blog posts and videos
(linked on the bottom of this post).</p>
<p>
From my point of view 2020 was the best AoC to date and I&#39;m not just
saying that because I finished all the problems. Well, maybe I am but
it&#39;s really because the content and release of content lent itself to
my completing all the problems.</p>
<p>
Before jumping in to my specific commentary I want to remind readers
that anyone&#39;s perceptions of an event like this will be biased. If
there&#39;s an aspect that I particularly liked you can bet there&#39;s
someone else out there who didn&#39;t like it.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-1">
Overall content
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
As usual a wide range of topics were covered including binary numbers,
pattern matching, simulation, dynamic programming, mathy stuff,
parsing, graph algorithms and more. </p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t find myself totally lost on any questions. There were some
problems that at least to me seemed to require graph algorithms and
one where dynamic programming or at least memoization was a boon but
for the most part it seemed that problems were indeed
approachable. Even the math day that had a bunch of reddit chatter
over the Chinese Remainder Theorem could be done without knowing about
the CRM. That was good because I had never heard of it (and if any of
the redditors who mentioned that it should  common knowledge, it
shouldn&#39;t - I have an undergrad in CS and a Masters in CS along wit 30
years of teaching and this is the first time I&#39;ve seen it). </p>
<p>
In past years there always seemed to be a few problems that you needed
some preexisting knowledge to attempt. I had no problem with that - no
need to have  to finish all the problems and there&#39;s nothing wrong
with hitting up reddit, learning something new and then tackling the
problem. This year it seemed that the problems more directly led to
the knowledge. I&#39;ll talk about this more later. </p>
</div>

<h2 id="headline-2">
Problem size
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
For the most part the problems were the perfect size for me. I&#39;d read
the problems when I woke up, work on part 1 after my run and then part
2 later in the day - at least that was the ideal - bugs and life
sometimes got in the way. None of the problems required pages and
pages of code for the solutions which I liked. Problems were clever
and interesting but led to moderately sized solution. </p>
<p>
In past years, the weekend problems were longer and/or harder. The
logic being that there&#39;s more time to work on them. I never liked
that. AoC is great but it&#39;s an add on. It&#39;s an add on to work during
the week but it&#39;s an add on to family time on the weekend. I liked
that this year the only weekend problem that was much larger and longer
was day 20 - the image reconstruction. </p>
<p>
This is not to say that some problems didn&#39;t take a good deal of time
but rather that once you had an approach you didn&#39;t sit down and say
&#34;oh man, now I have to write hundreds of lines of code to implement
this.&#34;</p>

<h2 id="headline-3">
particularly nice problems 
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
In spite of my not finishing part 2 until the last day, I loved day
20 - Jurassic Jigsaw. It was a little long and I spend more time than
I care to admit on debugging a really silly error but I loved the
problem.</p>
<p>
Why? </p>
<p>
First, it had staged difficulty -</p>
<ol>
<li>Parse the data into a reasonable representation</li>
<li>Do a partial edge matching for part 1 (not so hard)</li>
<li>Do the harder / longer matching to reconstruct the image</li>
<li>Remove the border and solve the problem.</li>
</ol>
<p>Second, you actually discovered something - you <strong>found</strong> sea
monsters!!!! You had a problem with an &#34;unknown&#34; solution and you
figured it out. Contrast that with say, day 2 where you just had to
validate passwords. That was also a fun problem but there was no big
reveal. It was really cool to decode your image and actaully find the
hidden monsters. </p>
<p>
Day 16 and 21 allowed for similar discovery at the end but not quite
as cool. I liked 16 very much but had a hard time getting my head
around the example for 21. Still a cool problem.</p>

Teachable stuff
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
As usual, I found a lot that I liked as a teacher in AoC. I love that
many of the problems introduce problem solvers to new things. For me,
the Chinese Remainder Theorem was new even though I only discovered it
via the subreddit. Cellular Automata was prominently featured
this year, binary explicitly mentioned as was recursion. </p>
<p>
The recursion problem was particularly nice. The setup led to and, if
I recall, explicitly mentioned recursion. It also talks about a key
challenge - data mutability. The question states that after returning
from a &#34;subgame&#34; - the recursion - you have to continue the original
game from where it left off - state management. If you&#39;re language
passes references in your calls this could lead to trouble. I&#39;m
guessing (hoping?) that for people who solved that day who were new to
recursion got a deeper understanding than just through the usual n!
and such.</p>
<p>
Another thing I liked was the spiraling. That, in teacher talk, is
when you go back to an earlier topic. This year had three questions
based on Cellular Autoamta. The first was the basic, the next took you
to a higher dimension and the third to a different shape. Each one
reviewed and extend fro the earlier problem. I loved it. This might
sound similar to last year&#39;s intcode but the difference is that evne
if you didn&#39;t complete the earlier problems you had a shot at the
latter ones. With Intcode if you had something wrong with your earlier
interpreter you were out of luck.</p>
<p>
The allergens problem also allowed for the use of the same method you
used to solve the boarding pass problem. </p>
<p>
Loved the spiraling.</p>
<p>
I could probably go on but this post is already long enough.</p>
