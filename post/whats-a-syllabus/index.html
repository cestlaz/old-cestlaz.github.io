Over in the Facebook CS Ed groups there was a discussion of the
forthcoming code.org APCS-A curriculum. As far as I can tell, the
curriculum isn&#39;t actually available yet so I can&#39;t really comment on it
but the discussion started with a concern about some of the
announcement. It made me think of what a curriculum was when I started
teaching, what it is now, and the ramifications of the change.</p>
<p>
Back when I started, I might get a math curriculum, a section of which
might have looked like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Day</th>
<th>Topic</th>
<th>Chapters</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>5,6</td>
<td>solving simple linear equations</td>
<td>3.1 - 3.4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td>solving more complex linear equations</td>
<td>3.5, 3.6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8-10</td>
<td>graphing linear equations</td>
<td>4.1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
etc.</p>
<p>
That was it. As a teacher, you knew the topic. If you had to get an
idea as to the depth of which to cover you looked at the text and
other resources you had in school and consulted with your
colleagues. You knew yourself, your school and your students and you designed
lessons to suit.</p>
<p>
This is a far cry from what you&#39;ll see today. Going back to the
forthcoming code.org apcs-a curriculum.  </p>
<p>
Here&#39;s the blurb that code.org provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CSA curricula have traditionally been focused on the building blocks
required to design solutions to problems through programming. Creating
this new curriculum with equity in mind means reimagining the
structure and pedagogy to excite and inspire students from
underrepresented racial and ethnic groups and young women while
teaching the technical building blocks and preparing students for the
AP® exam. Code.org’s CSA curriculum:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorporates culturally responsive and equitable teaching strategies
and frameworks by considering cultural references and learning styles
throughout the curriculum — from the vocabulary, to the visuals, to
the sequence of concepts taught.</li>
<li>Acknowledges diversity of experiences and interests. Students
investigate real-world problems during class activities and make
connections to their own work. Projects are carefully designed to be
instructive yet open-ended, enabling students to demonstrate mastery
of concepts and engage in their passions without making assumptions
about their cultural background or life experiences.</li>
<li>Brings to life a “Software Engineering for All” narrative. This
narrative helps students envision themselves as software engineers,
and the curriculum uses videos featuring presenters from different
backgrounds who work in technology to help students visualize
opportunities for their own futures.</li>
<li>Helps students develop and model valuable, real-world career
skills. In addition to skills like tracing code segments and
documenting code, Code.org’s approach to CSA incorporates
collaboration and career skills that go beyond the AP® CSA course
requirements. For example, our curriculum includes a student-friendly
code review tool, which is a common quality assurance practice in the
technology industry.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
There&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with any of this but it is worth
noting that the APCS-A class is indeed a course concerned with &#34;building blocks
required to design solutions to problems through programming.&#34; It is
based on a college CS1 class which is all about programming to solve
problems. Like it or not, that&#39;s the course.</p>
<p>
Now, having a culturally responsive course etc. etc. is all good and I
guess that since APCS-A is usually implemented a full year course to
cover a half year of college material there should, in theory, be room
for all the additions but that&#39;s not really here nor there.</p>
<p>
The thing is, APCS-A is supposed to be about programming. A well
taught APCS-A will be culturally responsive etc. but that&#39;s the
implementation. Unless something changed, that&#39;s not actually in the
course as defined by the college board or the college classes on which
it&#39;s based.</p>
<p>
This says to me that when code.org publishes its curriculum, it will
most likely resemble the products pushed by most modern curriculum
providers - really not just a curriculum but a collection of very
detailed units and lessons.</p>
<p>
Now, I do think that some of the things mentioned in the
code.org blurb like collaboration, software engineering, and other
topics like ethical ramifications <strong>should</strong> be in curricula but even
so, the exact lessons should be teacher designed and tuned to their
school and students. </p>
<p>
Again, nothing wrong with any of this. It can be a great and valuable resource,
particularly for an inexperienced teacher.</p>
<p>
But then, there is something wrong overall and it&#39;s with the direction
those with influence are taking as a profession. </p>
<p>
Teachers are less and less expected as much to know their subjects, their
students, and how to teach but rather to follow the script. This
approach might get those students past the standardized exam but in
the long run it&#39;s not giving students what they need nor deserve.</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve seen this every year in my undergraduate CS classes. Since APCS
Principles was launched many of my students have come in having taken
the classed and &#34;passed&#34; the exam. Truth be told, the majority of them
come in basically knowing nothing. This wouldn&#39;t be a problem if they
didn&#39;t come in thinking they knew quite a bit.  You can contrast that
with the students that come in having taken APCS-A. These students, by
and large, do indeed have a reasonably solid introduction to
programming under their belts. Further investigation usually reveals
what &#34;curriculum&#34; they learned under and the CS background of the
teacher.</p>
<p>
Some will argue that we need the crutch of the scripted lesson in
order to get started. Fair enough. I don&#39;t disagree with this basic
premise but the truth is that history seems to indicate that we&#39;re not
going to get beyond this. My favorite example is the old Cisco
networking class. Some teachers knew legit networks and decided to
teach the class - that was great. Some didn&#39;t and just had their
students use the Cisco provided computer based modules which, in my
opinion, weren&#39;t so great. Of those that didn&#39;t start with a
networking background, just about all I&#39;ve met never moved beyond
where they started in networking knowledge.</p>
<p>
I fear we&#39;re already seeing that in CS. School supervisors don&#39;t know
any better so they see that they can check off the computer science
box. Many teachers probably don&#39;t know better because their short term
training is focusing on how easy CS is and how you don&#39;t have to learn
anything to teach it rather than the truth - it&#39;s just like anything
else, it takes time and effort to really master. </p>
<p>
I already know that my view isn&#39;t the popular one but I&#39;ll say it over
and over until I retire - CS teachers really do need to know CS and
providers that provide short form &#34;training&#34; and scripted content,
unless they push with even more vigor, the next steps, are ultimately
going leave us in no better shape than we started. Kids in well to do
schools with administrations that can afford to bring in knowledgeable
experts and the gap will widen with the poorest getting the low
end scripted curricula.</p>
