            <p>
As we move through Fall, I&#39;m missing one of the most draining but at
the same time one of my favorite parts of the year. School recruiting
visits. </p>
<p>
When I came to Hunter, I started the Daedalus CS Honors program. We
started small but now, each year, we take in about fifty students,
give them a laptop and a scholarship and all sorts of extras and bring
them in for a great CS education at a fraction of the cost of say NYU
or Columbia. It is without a doubt the best value CS education, I&#39;d
say, maybe anywhere. The trouble is, we&#39;re still not that well known -
reputations in the school game take decades to establish and as Hunter
is still mostly known as a liberal arts / nursing school getting the
word out and building trust with students and teachers can be a chore.</p>
<p>
For the past four years I&#39;ve spent the Fall visiting schools. Pretty
much anyone who&#39;d have me as long as they have students who could be
interested in CS. I&#39;d trek out in the early morning on the subway to
all manner of neighborhoods and talk to students. I&#39;d hate the early
morning travel and the long subway rides but whenever I&#39;d get
somewhere I would stroll around a new or different
neighborhood. Afterwards, on my way back I could stop at local
shops. The challenge became finding some local food seller, usually a
bakery and get something that you can&#39;t get in Chelsea or the Upper
Easts Side. I&#39;d also get to visit all manner of schools - many built
under the WPA and many with walls of fame and other interesting
architecture, features and history. </p>
<p>
Of course, the real highlight was talking to students, teachers,
guidance counselors. Sometimes, I&#39;d address an entire senior class -
this is my favorite format - I get to talk to the CS and the non CS
students - makes for a much better diversity push. That was usually
followed by small group discussions with interested students. I&#39;d also
sometimes talk with one or more individual classes. Some visits though
get a bit crazy like visiting large schools with large CS programs
where I&#39;m bouncing from class to class all day.</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been told that my talks have been valuable - while I talk about
Daedalus and Hunter at the end, the talk is really about questions you
should ask when considering a college and considering a major with an
emphasis on CS. My theory is that I&#39;m not trying to con anyone into
coming to Hunter. I&#39;ve built a great program and Hunter / Hunter CS is strong
and affordable. I want to help the right fit students come to that
realization.</p>
<p>
Of course, now I can&#39;t do school visits so what to do? Zoom visits? I
don&#39;t think I&#39;ll come across as well but probably better than
nothing. In school? Should I set up evening sessions? </p>
<p>
I&#39;m not skilled at making fancy video presentations and I don&#39;t have
the charisma to just make a simple video that&#39;ll have the desired
effect so I&#39;m really struggling with this.</p>
<p>
So, any ideas out there? </p>
<p>
What&#39;s the best way for me to connect with good fits for Hunter CS?</p>
