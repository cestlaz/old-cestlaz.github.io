I spent yesterday at <a href="https://k12.tech.cornell.edu/what-we-do/to-code-and-beyond/">To Code and Beyond</a>, a one day conference put
together by my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/diane_levitt">Diane Levitt</a> and her team. This year the theme
was CS Education Research as it applies to K12 education.</p>
<p>
As usual, Diane and her team put together a great program and a great
day. Those of you who know me know that my personal relationship with
education research is, well, let&#39;s say, strained. I do believe that
there&#39;s some great work going on and I have many friends whom I both
like and respect very much who I think do great work. I also think
that that a <strong>huge</strong> amount of education research is, well,
questionable.</p>
<p>
On one of the conference panels, the question came up as to how we can
get &#34;the research&#34; into the hands of practicing teachers for them to
use. I think this is a great question but would add &#34;and how and when
would this be good and when would teachers rather not be burdened with
work they might find questionable.&#34;</p>
<p>
At the risk of angering some friends, I thought I&#39;d share my thoughts
on this today.</p>
<p>
how do we get &#34;the research&#34; into the teachers
hands in a practical way? And do they want it? </p>
<p>
My advice as a long time practitioner </p>
<ol>
<li>Don&#39;t research AT schools work WITH teachers and FOR teachers </li>
</ol>
<p>Mark&#39;s stuff</p>
<p>
get release time for teachers </p>
<ol>
<li>Walk the walk or give all the caveats  or give the #s and no
judgment</li>
<li>Get the powers that be to stop abusing research (good or bad)</li>
<li>who&#39;s going to get the crap off teachers plate (including things
like high stakes testing and CC) to make room </li>
</ol>
