            <p>
Yesterday was the last day on our first course for teacher
certification. A programming course similar to a college CS1 - think
APCS-A. We&#39;re now moving to a data structures course.</p>
<p>
There are a few reasons for this. First, it&#39;s depth of knowledge. The
most advanced class a high school student will normally take would be
APCS-A. Data structures is the next course. A teacher should have
studied a topic to a greater depth than the students. We fill in the
breadth in our topics course. Now, this means that our elementary
school candidates need data structures and I&#39;m the first one who&#39;ll
agree that elementary school teachers don&#39;t need the same depth of
knowledge as a high school teacher but New York State in it&#39;s infinite
wisdom decreed that their CS Certification would be K12 - same thing
for all teachers from Kindergarten through the end of high school.</p>
<p>
A second reason, and this is a big one, is that studying data
structures is a computer scientist or programmers first opportunity to
understand what&#39;s going on under the hood. Why is this important?
Well, to me, it&#39;s one of the differences between what, for lack of a
better word I&#39;ll call a coder or programmer with a computer scientist.</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not talking about a computer scientist as a college employed
researcher, I&#39;m using the term as someone who problem solves and
creates solutions using the tools and techniques of computer
science. For a coder / programmer, I mean someone who creates working
programs but doesn&#39;t think deeply about the solution but rather uses
built in constructs, libraries and packages blindly.</p>
<p>
This is not to say that someone employed as a coder can&#39;t be or isn&#39;t by my
definition, a computer scientist, they certainly can. </p>
<p>
Back to the point. We closed out the programming class learning about
classes and implementing something that we called a SuperArray,
basically a cut down Java Arraylist.</p>
<p>
On day one of data structures we went over the ArrayList. This is our
usual strategy - implement something and then you learn about and can
use the built in one.</p>
<p>
A poorly trained programmer will just learn about the ArrayList and
then use it blindly. But by first exploring something
like the SuperArray, the computer scientist has deeper knowledge.</p>
<p>
An ArrayList has a number of nice features. You can keep adding to
them paying little attention to size, you can delete from the middle,
insert anywhere and more. All these operations take time. If you try
to remove an element from an ArrayList, the ArrayList has to shift all
the elements past the element in question down. If you want to insert
at the front, you&#39;ve got to shift everything down to make room. Adding
something to the end, however, takes no time at all unless the
underlying array is full, in which case, more work is to be done.</p>
<p>
When writing the SuperArray, students had to write the code necessary to
do all of these operations so we can discuss the good, the bad, and
the ugly.</p>
<p>
If you are using an ArrayList and you blindly do all your insertions
at the front, you&#39;re going to have horrible performance but if you
always add to the end, things will be much faster. The coder doesn&#39;t
understand this but the computer scientist does.</p>
<p>
When we do LinkedLists next week we can dig deeper on these ideas and
even more when we get to sorting and searching.</p>
<p>
The bottom line is that even if one doesn&#39;t write an entire ArrayList,
exploring under the hood can arm a coder (or teacher) so that they
make wise choices instead of treating every problem like a nail.</p>
<p>
A side added bonus on this specific SuperArary / ArrayList
project is that when you&#39;re done you can actually look at the Java
ArrayList code. The class won&#39;t understand all of it but they should
be able to get the gist and they&#39;ll see that the Java code is very
similar to what the students wrote. This can be very empowering.</p>
<p>
After this data structures course, the teachers may never again write
the code for a linked list, implement a hash table or tree or manually
sort a data set but the underlying knowledge will help them understand
and teach all sorts of computer science concepts. A web page is
represented in a a tree, a network is a graph. Understanding hash
tables and search trees are a gateway to databases.</p>
<p>
Sometimes the specific implementations one studies are never used
again but for teachers, the underlying concepts can be game changes
for their students.</p>
