So I&#39;m teaching my Ethics and CS class for the first time. I
originally designed the course but didn&#39;t teach it the first time
around. That honor went to my friend, Master Teacher Topher
Mykolyk. He of course did an amazing job - impossible to
follow. Fortunately, this is a different cohort so they don&#39;t know how
great Topher was for the course :-).</p>
<p>
Even though I have the syllabus and Topher&#39;s notes from last time
around, first time through is very week to week but I think I&#39;m
starting to get my legs under me. </p>
<p>
This course is very different from what I&#39;ve taught in the past. It&#39;s
also  different from the ethics courses I&#39;ve seen currently out
there. Specifically, I wanted a programming component in the
course. Still, there&#39;s a lot more open ended discussion and opinion
based stuff going on.</p>
<p>
I mean, when you do a class on an algorithm like mergesort or a
construct like a loop, it is what it is. You can motivate it in
different ways and engage the class but there&#39;s only one punch line
and it&#39;s set in advance. Here things are a lot looser. Most issues
have two sides and even when most of the class is on one like when we
talked about predictive policing, we can still
effectively play devil&#39;s advocate for the other side. </p>
<p>
It can also lead to the class going sideways. Yesterday we were
talking about basic web privacy. Tracking, cookies and the like. In my
mind I had the lesson mapped out. First, our &#34;weekly ethicacy&#34; student
presentation and then a short breakout, discussion on the info we
share, and then curated questions and resources  that we&#39;d use in a
sequence of breakout room and whole class discussions. The trouble is,
after the first short breakout, the student conversation went directly
to what I had intended for our async work over the course of the
week. Oh well, time to <a href="/post/audible/">call an audible</a>. It wasn&#39;t really a big deal,
the conversation moved in a different direction but it was still very
much in the wheelhouse of the day&#39;s topic.</p>
<p>
Must be what an English class can be like.</p>
<p>
It was fun.</p>
<p>
Overall I think the course is doing well but I won&#39;t know for sure
until afterwards when I can debrief with the students. After all,
they&#39;re the ones that ultimately determine if the class is successful. </p>
<p>
Over the next few weeks I&#39;ll share some specifics about the class. The
programming stuff in particular. Can&#39;t do that now because we&#39;re in
the middle and I don&#39;t want any members of the class who might be
reading this to see the reveal before it&#39;s time.</p>
