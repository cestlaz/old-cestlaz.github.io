There&#39;s been a lot of chatter recently about the first programming
language to teach. First, I read a Facebook thread focussing on Java,
C and C++ and then, presumably unrelated, Mark Guzdial posted <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/253393-why-did-we-ever-think-the-first-programming-language-didnt-matter/fulltext">this</a>
which lead to another Facebook discussing and then yesterday I noticed
a Twitter thread started by someone in the Bootcamp world asking
people what their first language was which resulted in answers ranging
from JS to PHP to Perl to a bunch of others.</p>
<p>
A question Mark said he was thinking about recently was &#34;Why did
anyone ever think that the first programming language didn’t matter?&#34;</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think people were thinking it didn&#39;t matter but it was rather
like Anton Ego&#39;s commenting on Gusteu&#39;s &#34;Anyone can cook.&#34;</p>
<img width="300" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lS9ekZSoIxw/XRkKDhIOO5I/AAAAAAAAd9M/H-Bjekcvh4IH_86RZlFcAikZvbqBY7uuwCLcBGAs/s1600/anyone-can-cook-book.jpg">
<p>
It&#39;s not that anyone can cook but rather great cooking can come from
anywhere. It&#39;s not that the language doesn&#39;t matter but rather any
language (or maybe most any language) <strong>can</strong> be used as a first
language under the right set of circumstances.</p>
<p>
All to often the argument goes like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
&#34;I start my kids with C&#34;</p>
<p>
&#34;But that&#39;s no good - pointers - that&#39;s why I use Javascript - it&#39;s practical&#34;</p>
<p>
&#34;But the development tools are lousy for beginners, not to mention the tool chain&#34;</p>
<p>
&#34;Yeah but it&#39;s ubiquitous, anyway how about Java&#34;</p>
<p>
&#34;Too much overhead. Maybe scratch&#34;</p>
<p>
&#34;No way, the kids will think it&#39;s inauthentic.&#34;</p>
<p>
&#34;I know, apl!!!!!!!!&#34;</p>
<p>
&#34;DEAL!!!!&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Most of the discussion focuses on the language. Maybe on the related
toolset and ecosystem. A few of us though, have been pushing the fact
that there&#39;s more to the equation. Teacher knowledge, comfort, and
passion is a HUGE part of the equation. So is the student level and
background. Mark raised an important factor in his post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first programming language is particularly important when we think
about programming for other-than-CS majors. Students want to learn
what’s valued in their desired community of practice. If a student
wants to become a data scientist, R or Python makes a lot more sense
than learning C.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is probably more relevant at the college level than K12 but still
important to consider for the earlier grades as well. I say consider
though because, as always, the real answer is &#34;it depends.&#34; Back when
Bioinformatics started to get hot in the &#39;90s I seem to recall Perl
being the flavor of choice. Those of you who like me battled with Perl
and its &#34;write once read never&#34; approach to programming would agree
that even if it was the Lingua Franca of bioinformatics, I don&#39;t know
if I would take beginners down a path so fraught with peril.</p>
<p>
The truth is that the language does matter but there&#39;s a lot of
latitude. Probably more for a general purpose programming intro
rather than for a specific discipline but even then. All things being
equal, I&#39;d probably say that teacher comfort might be the most
important one to start with but that only holds when a teacher starts
teaching a class. I think it&#39;s beholden on the teacher to then explore
alternatives and if another language makes more sense, become familiar
with it.</p>
<p>
In any event, that&#39;s my two cents. This conversation comes around a
couple of times a year. A couple of rounds ago I think it revolved
around Javascript so, we&#39;re talking language. Last time, I and others
brought up teachers, their backgrounds and comfort levels. Now Mark&#39;s
bringing another dimension. It&#39;s nice to see the dialog evolving.</p>
