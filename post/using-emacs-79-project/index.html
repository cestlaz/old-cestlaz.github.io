            <p>
One of the comments on my last video talked about the new project
management support Emacs includes in it&#39;s latest version -
project.el. I remembered reading about it when it rolled around but
then forgot and never checked it out.</p>
<p>
Up until recently when working in projects I used <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile">Projectile</a>, a great
package by <a href="https://twitter.com/bbatsov">Bozhidar Batsov</a>, also known as Bug. I only used it when
doing development work - that&#39;s when I find myself jumping around
within a group of related files. At other times, I&#39;m pretty much in
one file, do my thing, then move on.</p>
<p>
I wrote a post and did a video on Projectile a while ago - you can
check it out [[<a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-33-projectile-jump/">https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-33-projectile-jump/</a>
][here]].</p>
<p>
As I mentioned in the last video, I decided to rebuild my Emacs config
from scratch and I&#39;m trying to be a bit more minimalist so with that
reminder I got, I figure it&#39;s time to check out the now built in
project.el. If it&#39;s as good as projectile, or even, good enough, it
could be a nice alternative.</p>
<p>
At it&#39;s core, project.el works similarly to projectile. There&#39;s a
prefix key an then an action which is restricted to your project. For
projectile, it was <code>C-c p</code> and the default for project.el is <code>C-x
p</code>. No big difference there. Projectile seems to have many many more
options but in general, I find that all I need is</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch to a project - <code>C-x p p</code></li>
<li>Find or open a file in a project - <code>C-x p f</code></li>
<li>Switch buffers in a project - <code>C-x p b</code></li>
<li>Delete all the project buffers - <code>C-x p k</code></li>
<li>List the project buffers</li>
</ul>
<p>Project.el has all except listing all the buffers. It also supports a
few other features that I think I&#39;ll find useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>project dired - <code>C-x p d</code></li>
<li>project shell (or eshell) <code>C-x p s</code></li>
<li>project regex search and variants <code>C-x p g</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m not sure if projectile has these. It probably does and I could see
them being useful. I probable won&#39;t use the regex searches much
because I&#39;ll likely use other tools for those like consult-ripgrep.</p>
<p>
So, it certainly seems like project.el has enough coverage for my
purposes. Another difference between the two projects is that
project.el only supports a couple of project definitions - things that
are supported by Emacs&#39; VC system ad things supported by Emacs EDE
thing (which I&#39;ve never really played with). I seem to recall
Projectile being more flexible.</p>
<p>
In any event, project.el looks like it&#39;s a nice simple alternative at
least for me. Check out the video for the runthrough:</p>
