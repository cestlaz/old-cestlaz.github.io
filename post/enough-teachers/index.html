A common refrain against requiring CS in our K12 schools is that we
don&#39;t have the teachers and we won&#39;t any time soon. Sure, we don&#39;t
right now but we won&#39;t if we don&#39;t do something about it.

<p>
The question to ask is &#34;how long will it take&#34; and &#34;how do we get
there?&#34;
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s look at New York City. We&#39;ve got approximately 1,000,000
students in our public schools. Let&#39;s say that&#39;s grades 1
to 12. That&#39;s 8333 per grade. Let&#39;s take one particular grade and see
how many classes. At 34 students per class we get 2450 classes. Since
teachers typically teach five classes that means to cover 1 class for
every student in one particular grade we&#39;ll need about 500 teachers to
cover a full year class. 250 if the class is only one semester. 
</p>
<p>
This if, of course, just back of the envelope calculating and we&#39;d
need a good deal more to really do justice to teaching CS in K12 but
500 sounds like a reasonable critical mass to say &#34;we&#39;re teaching CS.&#34;
</p>
<p>
How long until we can get there?
</p>
<p>
At Hunter we started our advanced certificate program a year
ago. The cert program is specifically for teachers licensed in another
area seeking to add the New York State CS credential. Our first cohort
graduated 21 and I can proudly say they&#39;re all very well prepared to
teach CS in K12. They know their content and how to teach it. We&#39;re
starting another batch in two weeks and a third cohort next summer. By
June 2023 we should have between 60 and 100 teachers certified. That&#39;s
not bad. We&#39;ll have a core group of teacher leaders three years from
our start. 
</p>
<p>
How are we doing this? What&#39;s the incentive for current teachers to
get this new certification? It&#39;s an opportunity to really learn some
CS and how to teach it. All the training and PD based models just
don&#39;t cut it long term. On the other hand, it costs a pretty penny -
21 graduate credits. True, those credits can be applied to salary
differentials but still. Also, while the state could just flat out
require the certification but they&#39;ve put in a generous ramp up -
teachers will need the credential but not for a few year.
</p>
<p>
The biggest reason we&#39;ve been able to get these teachers in is the
generosity of the New York Tech community. We&#39;ve been able to provide
financial support to these teachers looking to be our leaders moving
forward. 
</p>
<p>
Going with that, we have 4 students currently in our Masters program
with another 6 or so slated to start in the Fall and that&#39;s with zero
advertising and outreach. I expect that in a couple of years, the
demand for the certificate program will wane while it accelerates for
the masters program. 
</p>
<p>
We&#39;re not going to have all the teachers we need in three years or
even in five but in three we&#39;ll have a solid core. As other
certification programs come online the city will increase it&#39;s teacher
training capacity and as we close in on 2026 when CS4All will expect
all schools to offer CS, we&#39;ll have a good number of qualified
teachers to fill the need.
</p>
<p>
Sure, it&#39;ll take a decade or longer to finish the job but you&#39;ve got
to start with a plan and a vision and lots of support. At least in NYC
we&#39;ve got all three.
