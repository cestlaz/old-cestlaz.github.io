Last time, I wrote about frustrations in trying to <a href="/post/learn-new-language/">motivate myself to
learn ocaml</a>. I could see the strong points but given that I&#39;ve been
using Clojure now for a while, it didn&#39;t really hold any value added
for me in my current situation.</p>
<p>
Next, I thought I&#39;d explore Rust. On the non-functional style, my go to
languages have always been Python for scripting and small things and C
professionally. I also used and taught C++ and Java. I always loved
C&#39;s minimalism but it was pretty bare bones and Java and C++ while
more modern both also have their warts so it made sense to see if
there was a language I&#39;d like to use instead of any of those three.</p>
<p>
A number of years ago, I decided to explore Go for this. Go had some
nice features. It didn&#39;t do a full blown object oriented thing but
rather a more lightweight way of defining structures and binding
functionality to structures. I guess like interfaces. Since I&#39;m not a
big OOP person but did like the occasional object abstraction this was
great. I also loved goroutines for concurrency. On the other hand, I
didn&#39;t like the lack of functional goodness so ultimately I stopped
pursuing Go.</p>
<p>
This time, it was Rust&#39;s turn. Here&#39;s a list of a few of the things
that drew me to Rust:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good learning resources</li>
<li>Good dev experience under Emacs</li>
<li>Static typing</li>
<li>immutable by default</li>
<li>Supports the other functional goodness that I like</li>
</ul>
<p>I just started playing and so far I like it. In addition to the above
I&#39;m also seeing some other positives. It has pattern matching which I
mentioned in my previous post and the object model looks more like Go
than like C++ or Java so that&#39;s a plus.</p>
<p>
Another big potential positive is Rust&#39;s concept of ownership. An
informal way of thinking about it is that it&#39;s how Rust deifnes what
can access memory. In Rust,  if you have code like this (lifted from
the Rust Book):</p>
<div class="src src-rust">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">let</span> s1 <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> String::from(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;hello&#34;</span>);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">let</span> s2 <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> s1;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    println!(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;{}, world!&#34;</span>, s1);</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
you&#39;ll get an error. Once you assign s1 to s2 then s2 owns the memory
with the string &#34;hello&#34; so when you try to access it, you get an
error. Of course, Rust has ways of dealing with this including 
explicitly declared mutability and references and maybe other things I
haven&#39;t gotten to yet so it isn&#39;t really a problem. I can also see it
as being a really strong way of encouraging the writing of safe
programs.</p>
<p>
I&#39;m pretty early on in the journey - I though I might try Advent of
code this year in Rust but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be sufficiently up to
speed on it yet but we&#39;ll see. In any event, it seems to be a very
cool language and a strong C++ or Java alternative.</p>
<p>
A strong alternative at least in terms of using. For teaching, that&#39;s
another story. For me, learning hasn&#39;t been a problem since I&#39;ve been
around the block a few times but I could see the language being a
challenge for beginners. Lot&#39;s of cognitive overhead for the ownership
thing as well as general scope rules and the way mutability works. I
think all these features are great for the language but I suspect that
it wouldn&#39;t fly very well in a CS0 course.</p>
<p>
So, I&#39;m feeling that Rust&#39;s a go and I look forward to continuing to
explore the language. If you want to check it out, start here:
