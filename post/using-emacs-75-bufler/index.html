Quick Emacs hit today.</p>
<p>
After my last video, I received a comment noting that I was using
ibuffer and that there was another package I might want to consider -
<a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/bufler.el">bufler</a>. </p>
<p>
I started with basic ibuffer and then started to <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-34-ibuffer-emmet/">customize it</a> to group
buffers but that was always somewhat finicky. More often than not I
couldn&#39;t tune it the way I wanted. Most recently, I started using
<a href="https://github.com/purcell/ibuffer-projectile">ibuffer-projectile</a> which group projects for me but lost the other
customizations. In any event, I was more or less happy with things.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/bufler.el">Bufler</a> though looks to be a nice alternative. Out of the box it looks
like it groups things pretty well and has a nice Emacs <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra">hydra</a> that you
can bring up with <code>?</code> to remind you how to do things like kill one or
more buffers.  </p>
<p>
Right now, I&#39;m using it as an ibuffer replacement but it also has its
own version of switch buffer that I plan to play with as well. </p>
<p>
The only knit I&#39;ve found thus far is that when you run bufler, it
splits the window and lists the buffers in the new space. If I&#39;m using
ibuffer I want it to use the whole Emacs frame. Otherwise I just use
ivy-switch-buffer (or now bufler-switch-buffer). I couldn&#39;t figure out
a way built in so ended up writing a small function: </p>
<p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-lisp" data-lang="lisp">(defun mz/bufler-one-window (<span style="color:#66d9ef">&amp;optional</span> force-refresh)
  (interactive <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;P&#34;</span>)
  (bufler-list)
  (delete-other-windows)

)

(global-set-key (kbd <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;C-x C-b&#34;</span>) <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;mz/bufler-one-window</span>)</code></pre></div></p>
