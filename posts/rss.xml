      <title>Blight Move</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
It was Jon and Amy&amp;#39;s wedding. Jon was my student back in the day so
there were a handful of Stuy alums there to celebrate the
occasion. Some, like Jon, I had stayed in touch with and now count as
friends. Others, I knew but hadn&amp;#39;t kept up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was with a cluster of guests and for some reason the conversation
turned to chess computers. I started telling a  story about the my former
teacher &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2012-05-09-my-favorite-year-teacher.html&#34;&gt;Herb Greenhut&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s Talking Chess Challenger computer. You would
type in your move using modern algebraic chess notation using a kaypad
and the program would not only respond by displaying it&amp;#39;s move in said
notation but also speak it in it&amp;#39;s best &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567/&#34;&gt;War Games&lt;/a&gt; voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D5 TO E6 - PAWN TAKES ROOK&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Herb had a friend Dan,  who was a decent chess player but nowhere good
enough to compete with someone at the theoretical level of the Chess
Challenger at it&amp;#39;s higher levels. Even so he came up not only with a way
to beat the computer but also to cause it to have a nervous breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Dan figured that the computer assumed a sensible opponent so when it
considered its next move it built a tree assuming the human player
would try to find strong moves. Dan would play crazy outlandish moves
so that the computer would have to spend all its time working through
game trees and then settle on a bad move having not found the right
move path. Dan didn&amp;#39;t know anything about computer science, search
trees or Alpha Beta pruning but he was a smart guy and just figured it
out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At one point, he made a crazy move and the computer responded
something like &amp;#34;C4 TO E5&amp;#34; and all of a sudden, I hear blurted out from
a voice from across the wedding reception &amp;#34;BLIGHT MOVE!!!!!!!!&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I looked over and it was Mikey, a former student who I had not kept in
contact with who had finished the story. What had happened is that the
computer had started to create new pieces. In this case a &amp;#34;blight&amp;#34;
which we eventually determined could move as either a bishop or a
knight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The cool thing to me was that this was a dumb story I told my classes in
1994 or 5 and here we were some twenty years later and Mikey
remembered it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You really never know what your students will remember about you or
your classes years into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was reminded of this when I saw this tweet the other day:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;For anyone wondering, this poll was in response to the quote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;They may forget what you said, but they will never forget how you made them feel.&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/QHMXTxjeLA&#34;&gt;https://t.co/QHMXTxjeLA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Adam Boxer (@adamboxer1) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/adamboxer1/status/1041051593255411713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;September 15, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t know the context of the quote but &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/adamboxer1&#34;&gt;Adam Boxer&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s reply in the
tweet stream seems to indicate that it comes from the thought that
they won&amp;#39;t remember the content so it isn&amp;#39;t important as long as the
kids feel good about themselves. The truth is that as a K12 teacher
we&amp;#39;re responsible for both the students development in the subject and
also as a person and while people might not remember the name of the
teacher that taught them anything in particular and in spite of people
saying they learned &amp;#34;nothing in school&amp;#34; the truth is there&amp;#39;s quite a
bit that most people do learn from their teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In terms of how students feel, I&amp;#39;m guessing there are some kids who
felt that I made them feel smart or capable and probably some that I
ended up inadvertently turning off but the majority probably didn&amp;#39;t
feel much of an impact in terms of how I made them feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, it&amp;#39;s pretty amazing the range of things they do
remember. Some academic, some ancillary, some just plain silly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I heard through a secondary source that Liz, mamy years out still
remembers the recursive sock puppets I use. Since Liz is a successful
software engineer I&amp;#39;m guessing she remembers the recursion as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Blake told me last year that the short edit, save, test, commit cycle
I used made an impact on him. That&amp;#39;s something I mention but really
mostly model in class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A couple of years ago, when out in California, I was visiting with
Pawel who was in my class in the early 90s. He reminded me of a lesson
that really made an impact on him. It was on a day when I decided to
throw the planned lesson out the window and ended up working thorugh
how I would approach and try to solve one of the recent USACO problems
going from reading the problem to working solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course they all remember the Halloween costumes but that&amp;#39;s neither
here nor there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve had students tell me other things they remember. Sometimes, I
don&amp;#39;t even recall saying them. That&amp;#39;s an important point. It might be a
throwaway line for us as teachers but it can have a huge impact or at
least be really memorable for the listener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s just another reminder of the impact we can have and the
responsibility we must take seriously as teachers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creating a school for CS</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/creating-a-school/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.acthompson.net/2018/09/do-we-really-need-cs-focused-high.html&#34;&gt;Do we really need CS focused high schools?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That&amp;#39;s the question Alfred Thompson asked partly in reaction to my
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/that-time-bill-gates-visited-afse&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; talking about Bill Gates&amp;#39; visit to &lt;a href=&#34;http://afsenyc.org&#34;&gt;AFSE&lt;/a&gt;, a NYC public school
with a CS focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On both posts, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/reallymdp&#34;&gt;Michael Preston&lt;/a&gt; shared some important and good points about
AFSE as a starting point and gateway that helped lead to CS4All in NYC
and also specifically about AFSE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In response to Alfred&amp;#39;s question I thought it was time I shared a bit
about what I was pushing for AFSE back when I was involved. I wasn&amp;#39;t
able to talk publicly about any of this at the time because I was
warned very sternly by one DOE person involved that I shouldn&amp;#39;t talk
to &amp;#34;outsiders&amp;#34; about my concerns or designs. In retrospect, since I
stopped getting replies to my emails and was apparently dropped from
email lists after they selected their founding principal, I probably
should have been more public about my critiques. On the other hand, I
should have been more politic internally prior to getting to that
point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Reading Alfred&amp;#39;s post, what I was pushing for AFSE at the time cuts
right to Alfred&amp;#39;s question so I thought I&amp;#39;d write about it today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before starting though I want to be &lt;strong&gt;absolutely clear&lt;/strong&gt; about one
thing. This is not a critique of AFSE as it stands. There are some
great teachers and wonderful students there and I do what I can to
support both whenever I can. This is a post about my design vs the
DOE&amp;#39;s design and later implementation. Also note that the numbers,
sizes, restrictions and designs are all based on NY state and NYC
requirements along with what one can typically do in a NYC public
school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even though it&amp;#39;s the least important issue with respect to a CS school
or not, let&amp;#39;s start by getting the dirty word out of the way. Given
the stated mission of the school (at the time) I wanted a screen. Not
a &amp;#34;Stuy test&amp;#34; screen but something. Probably something more along the
lines of the screen used by the Manhattan Science Hunter High
School. We never got that far in discussing it. My contention was and
still is that if you want to produce &amp;#34;Google ready&amp;#34; software engineers
by high school graduation, particularly in a small school, you can&amp;#39;t
start with kids 2 or 3 years behind in math. Now, if your goal isn&amp;#39;t
&amp;#34;Google ready engineers&amp;#34; but rather to use CS to engage a population
that isn&amp;#39;t otherwise engaged, I can get behind that and you don&amp;#39;t need
a screen. It&amp;#39;s important however to note it&amp;#39;s a different mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The DOE would maintain that you don&amp;#39;t need any screen and kids can
start out years behind and by the end of their senior year they&amp;#39;d be
years ahead. It doesn&amp;#39;t work that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They&amp;#39;d ask tech people at meetings what they looked for in employees
knowing that they&amp;#39;d get back &amp;#34;teamwork, creativity etc.&amp;#34; I would of
course follow up with &amp;#34;where do you look for these candidates&amp;#34; and
they&amp;#39;d say &amp;#34;MIT, Cal Tech, Harvard.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The DOE insisted on no screen. This is fine but it&amp;#39;s no surprise that
Google&amp;#39;s not beating down the doors for AFSE graduates right out of
high school and the math regents show that you indeed can&amp;#39;t take kids
from multiple years behind and end up with them multiple years ahead
given typical school resources. They&amp;#39;re doing really good work there
but there&amp;#39;s no such thing as a miracle school just hard work and
incremental progress. I have heard more than once that the founding
principal had lobbied for a screen so I feel my original assessment
was correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next up, size. The DOE insisted on a small school focused on CS. They
wanted a school of around 136 kids per grade, which makes for 4
&amp;#34;homerooms,&amp;#34; and that the school would focus on CS. My proposal was
very different. I advocated for a school with about 340 kids per grade
and not specifically focused on CS but rather with a great model CS
program - a Software Engineering Institute at the blah blah school if
you would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A small school can&amp;#39;t support a wide range of classes. With 4 classes
of kids per grade you don&amp;#39;t have a lot of schedule flexibility in
terms of class levels or electives. You also have very few teachers
per subject - for a subject taught for a full year every year for a
single period, you&amp;#39;d have one teacher per grade in that subject. If
you&amp;#39;re a school for CS you&amp;#39;re not going to be able to offer a robust
schedule of music or arts classes. Likewise an arts school is going to
be hard pressed to offer a suite of science electives. Remember,
public schools are not flush with money and can&amp;#39;t just offer loads of
courses for a handful of kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What we end up with is a school with limited offerings beyond CS and
we&amp;#39;re asking kids to decide in 8th grade if that&amp;#39;s the career path for
them. This is a hidden problem of all small schools. Kids shouldn&amp;#39;t
have to decide on their future in the 8th grade. They should all be
able to go to schools that offer a wide range of subjects to a good
degree of depth. Only large public schools can do this. I know that
public schools come with their own problems but this is one of the
trade offs. I believe that having this selection done in 8th grade
along with the tech stereotypes and preconceptions is a big part of
the schools difficulty in appealing to girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now even if every student who applied and is randomly accepted into
AFSE does indeed want to be a CS person then we&amp;#39;ve also lost because
we&amp;#39;ve done nothing to get more kids into the pool. It could still
potentially function as a model school in terms of courses or possibly
pedagogy but it won&amp;#39;t expose and inspire anyone new with respect to
tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s contrast that with what I proposed. I wanted around 340 kids per
grade or 10 &amp;#34;homerooms.&amp;#34; How did I arrive at that number? It wasn&amp;#39;t
just a guess. Schools like Stuyvesant or Brooklyn Tech are clearly too
large and impersonal but small 136 kids per grade schools are too
small. The 10 homeroom per grade school seems to be the best
compromise. There are enough teachers so that there&amp;#39;s institutional
memory when one leaves, enough of them and students for a varied set
of electives. It also means that there are enough teachers to avoid
bad fits between teacher and student. At the same time, it&amp;#39;s not so
large that kids get lost. I also spoke with some of the best
programmers I know - not computer programmers but people who schedule
students for classes in schools and this seems to be the best
compromise size range. Also, with this size you don&amp;#39;t necessarily need
a screen if you want &amp;#34;Google ready&amp;#34; software engineers. There will be
enough of a range kids that come in behind and kids that come in ahead
can get what they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also didn&amp;#39;t want it to be a CS school but rather a school with great
CS. That way it would appeal to a range of students. Kids who think
they want to do CS and those who don&amp;#39;t. At the end of they day some of
the kids that think they wanted CS won&amp;#39;t want it and those kids will
have other options. At the same time some of the non-tech kids will
take the required CS and find out that &amp;#34;this is neat stuff&amp;#34; and we get
to increase the number of people in the tent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I still believe my design would have worked out better but that&amp;#39;s not
to say that I don&amp;#39;t think that AFSE has been and is important. As Mike
pointed out in his comment, AFSE was the first unscreened school to
offer legit and it did (and does) offer a place for CS kids that don&amp;#39;t
get into or don&amp;#39;t want to go to a place like Stuy which is very much a
large school and an unforgiving machine. It was also a showpiece that
helped pave the way for CS in all NYC schools. All of that&amp;#39;s good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I do regret parts of what went down between me and DOE. I don&amp;#39;t regret
sticking to my beliefs in terms of school design but I would like to
have been able to handle the politics of the situation better. Had I
remained involved I think I had more to offer. I don&amp;#39;t regret it too
much – at the time it went from the DOE telling me one week to &amp;#34;you
can have any role in the school you want&amp;#34; to the next week &amp;#34;we want to
introduce you to the person who we&amp;#39;re making principal&amp;#34; and I
recognize that I&amp;#39;d have a hard time putting that aside now and the me
of a decade ago would have found it impossible. That said, I think
everyone would have been better off if both sides could have played
things better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;d still love to have the chance someday to set up and run a school
of my design with my team. It&amp;#39;ll probably never happen but it would be
nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>That Time Bill Gates Visited AFSE</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/that-time-bill-gates-visited-afse/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/that-time-bill-gates-visited-afse/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
AFSE stands for the Academy for Software Engineering. It&amp;#39;s a public
school in New York City with a stated focus on, well, software
engineering. I have some history with the school and its creation but
that&amp;#39;s not what this post is about. In fact, this post isn&amp;#39;t really
about AFSE at all. I plan to neither praise or critique the
school. This is about what Bill Gates &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gatesnotes.com/Education/My-visit-to-the-Academy-for-Software-Engineering&#34;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about his recent visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t know the circumstances of the visit but I&amp;#39;m guessing it wasn&amp;#39;t
a surprise. More likely it was a scheduled visit and the school, at
least to some extent put on the usual dog and pony show. Teachers
know all about this – the superintendent&amp;#39;s coming - make sure your
bulletin boards are all set. Let&amp;#39;s nudge the guest to the right
classes, let&amp;#39;s make sure to show our best side. I could be wrong, this
could have been a surprise visit or Bill could have gone into random
classes talking to random students but that&amp;#39;s unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Bill says that &amp;#34;Unlike some specialized schools there are no criteria
for admission.&amp;#34; First, it&amp;#39;s not a specialized school, it&amp;#39;s a themed
school just as all NYs small schools are. That&amp;#39;s just another way of
saying &amp;#34;small school that can&amp;#39;t support a robust elective program.&amp;#34;
Bill sounds to be still enamored with small schools. In the video
accompanying his post, Bill describes the school by saying &amp;#34;The idea
is it&amp;#39;s a small high school with teachers that want to engage students
on a very personal level and come up with a personalized learning
plan…&amp;#34; I guess teachers at larger schools don&amp;#39;t want to engage their
students at a personal level? Personal learning plan? That inherently
has nothing to do with small schools but it does sound like it has
something to do with software he can sell to other peoples kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Bill talks about it being a diverse school while noting that it&amp;#39;s very
male heavy (80% in 2016) but I wonder what the culture of the school
is like compared to the greater tech community. Does it exhibit the
best of inclusive diversity or the worst or somewhere in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Bill also talks about the unique curriculum noting how a history
teacher might allow a student to make a web page instead of preparing
an oral presentation. This isn&amp;#39;t unique at all. I know many teachers
across the city that do this. It also isn&amp;#39;t necessarily a good or
bad thing without context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The title of the piece is &amp;#34;How 3D printers are preparing students for
life after high school&amp;#34; and Bill gushes about a design class he
observed. A design class can be amazing and I&amp;#39;m guessing the one he
saw was, but the 3D printers are incidental. In fact, many educators
don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re particularly useful or valuable. They&amp;#39;re
expensive, they break, they use consumables which cost money and
printing time make instant gratification impossible. Sure, they&amp;#39;re
nice toys but when you&amp;#39;re stretching your budget to its breaking
point are they really worth it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I read this I kept wondering if Bill had really learned anything
from his past failures in coercing public education to his whims. Then
I got to this: &amp;#34;The school enrolls fewer than 500 kids, so class sizes
are small, &amp;#34; That&amp;#39;s not how it works and if Bill was actually paying
attention or cared he&amp;#39;d know this. Small schools in NYC have around
544 kids. That&amp;#39;s four grades of 136 student each. Each grade is made
up of four classes of 34 students each which is the NYC class size. It
doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you have 500 in your school or 5000. The class size
will still be around 34 unless extra funds are available to lower
it. Bill further talks about teachers using a shared data portal and
advisors connecting with families and attributes all this to AFSE
being a small school when it really has to do with having more funds
per student and not the school size at all. He also doesn&amp;#39;t seem to
notice how his small schools can&amp;#39;t offer great art and music unless
they&amp;#39;re art and music themed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why am I writing this? Because people like Bill Gates wield great
wealth and great power and Bill&amp;#39;s past efforts in education have
hurt schools much more than they&amp;#39;ve helped them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Has he learned anything? As far as I can tell, not a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I said this post wasn&amp;#39;t about AFSE and it isn&amp;#39;t but I will share a few
thoughts here at the end. As with all public schools with open
admission in NYC they face some pretty big challenges. They have some
great champions like founder and NYC mensch, Fred
Wilson along with other players in the tech industry. AFSE was also a
special project of the Bloomberg administration under which it was
created. I think this has meant that they&amp;#39;ve had resources that might
not be available as readily to other schools. Resources like the ones
mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;https://avc.com/2016/01/the-first-annual-afse-fundraiser/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s great that the kids at AFSE have these resources
but sad that so many other kids don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As CS becomes a subject in all schools what will happen with AFSE?
Will they continue to be able to raise the necessary funds for the
extras?  Will it affect the kids who apply? Will it make them less
desirable to &amp;#34;techy&amp;#34; kids since CS will be available at many schools
or will it make it easier to get non tech types. Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Do you need to know binary for CS?</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/why-binary/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/why-binary/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Alfred Thompson asked &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/alfredtwo/status/1036982959587446784&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Why is it important for CS students
to understand binary?&amp;#34;&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter which led to a number of interesting
responses. Alfred summarized and wrote his own thoughts on &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.acthompson.net/2018/09/why-teach-binary-in-computer-science.html&#34;&gt;his blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I wanted to add a comment but I already wrote a post for yesterday so
put it off until today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First let me say that you can have a very successful career in tech
and not really know binary or number bases other than 10. That career
could be as as programmer, software engineer, network specialist,
devops or in many other areas that fall on the CS side of tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You also can&amp;#39;t really get through a CS program without learning about
binary. If you&amp;#39;re self taught or go to a code school then that&amp;#39;s
another story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The question is, is it worth the time spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One can easily argue that systems - that is low level, close to the
metal knowledge is one of the two &amp;#34;latins&amp;#34; of CS, the other being CS
theory. You might not explicitly use either but they give you a
stronger foundation in everything. You also can&amp;#39;t study systems without a
good knowledge of binary so if you want to do anything low level, you
need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about beyond those easy but not all to convincing to new students
answers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s loo at a few things we can do with binary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A big part of binary notation is that you can look at data as a string
of bits. You can also manipulate that data using things like &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;not&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;xor&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At it&amp;#39;s core &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; let&amp;#39;s you turn off bits. &lt;code&gt;And&lt;/code&gt; any bit with a 0 and
it will become a 0. &lt;code&gt;And&lt;/code&gt; it with a 1 and it stays the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
\begin{array}{ccccc}
&amp;amp;1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0\\
and &amp;amp;0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1\\\hline
&amp;amp;0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0\\
\end{array}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Or&lt;/code&gt; is used to turn on bits. You &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; any bit with a 1 and it gets
turned on. &lt;code&gt;Or&lt;/code&gt; it with a 0 and it stays as it was.
$$
\begin{array}{ccccc}
&amp;amp;1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0\\
or &amp;amp;0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1\\\hline
&amp;amp;1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1\\
\end{array}
$$
&lt;code&gt;Xor&lt;/code&gt; a bit with a 1 and the bit flips, with a 0 it stays the same.
$$
\begin{array}{ccccc}
&amp;amp;1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0\\
xor &amp;amp;0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1\\\hline
&amp;amp;1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1\\
\end{array}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What can we do with this? For one thing, image processing. Students
frequently play with images where each pixel is represented as a 24
bit color. Three bytes, one each for red, green, and blue. Each byte
is really 8 bits. We can use bitwise operations on the binary digits
to turn on or off color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s say we have this rgb triple: (200, 15, 80) which in hexadecimal
is C8 0F 50 or 10111000 00001111 01010000 in binary. If we want to
turn off the reddest reds we could &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; the color with 00001111
11111111 11111111 or 0FFFFF:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$
\begin{array}{cccc}
&amp;amp; 10111000 &amp;amp; 00001111 &amp;amp; 01010000\\
and &amp;amp; 00001111 &amp;amp; 11111111 &amp;amp; 11111111\\\hline
&amp;amp; 00001000 &amp;amp; 00001111 &amp;amp; 01010000\\
\end{array}
$$
Yes, you could just use the base 10
values and keep on calling color setting and conversion functions but
if you understand binary it&amp;#39;s quicker and easier and what&amp;#39;s going on
will actually make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course you probably wouldn&amp;#39;t write out the binary but would rather
use the hex notation which once a student realizes is just 4 bit
groupings of binary becomes really easy. As a bonus, once you&amp;#39;re used
to binary and hex those hexadecimal color values will all of a sudden
make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is just the tip of the image processing and graphics iceberg with
respect to binary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Related although I haven&amp;#39;t played with it myself, I&amp;#39;d imagine you could use
these types of bitwise operations on images to play with
steganography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another use of binary is in cybersecurity. Things like buffer
overflows and blowing the stack all make much more sense if you know
how memory is arranged and that&amp;#39;s easier to understand if you
understand binary, bytes, and word sizes. I do experiments with my
classes when we use C or C++ where they access arrays off the ends and
end up messing with neighboring variables. It seems like magic unless
you know about memory and to know memory you need to know binary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How about image file formats? Many image file formats start with a
fixed size header. Here&amp;#39;s the header definition for the GIF file
format:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;Offset&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Length&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Contents&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3  bytes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;#34;GIF&amp;#34;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3  bytes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;#34;87a&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;89a&amp;#34;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2  bytes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;Logical Screen Width&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2  bytes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;Logical Screen Height&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1  byte&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;bit0: Global Color Table Flag (GCTF)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;bit&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1..3:  Color&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Resolution&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;bit&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4:  Sort&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Flag to Global Color Table&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;bit&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5..7:  Size&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;of Global Color Table:2^(1+n)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1  byte&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;Background Color Index&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1  byte&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;Pixel Aspect Ratio&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?  bytes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;Global Color Table(0..255 x 3 bytes)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;bytes  &amp;lt;Blocks&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;bytes  &amp;lt;Trailer&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(0x3b)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The header info is defined bit by bit so you have to know about binary
and know how to manipulate data on a bit level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Those were three biggies but there are other places where knowing
binary makes tons of sense:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;flag type parameters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;understanding floating point numbers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;using shifts for quick doubling and halving of data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this mean that binary has to be or should be in a first course?
No. Should it be somewhere? Certainly and rather than doing binary
because it&amp;#39;s on the test or because &amp;#34;you should know it&amp;#34; you can pick
and choose your spots and cover it when it will be fun and interesting
for your kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Wishing all K12 teachers a great year</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/starting-school-2018/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/starting-school-2018/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Today was the first day of school for all NYC teachers. Students come
back tomorrow. That&amp;#39;s a quick turnaround. Some years, they get a day
or two before the kids come in. That&amp;#39;s much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first day is usually dominated by meetings. In a large school like
Stuy you&amp;#39;ll typically have a long faculty meeting in the morning and a
department meeting in the afternoon. Not much time to actually get
ready for classes. You might think that it shouldn&amp;#39;t be a big deal
since you had all summer but in NYC where budgets don&amp;#39;t come out until
the summer for teachers not to know exactly what or when they&amp;#39;re
teaching until the first day back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Things started at Hunter college last week but things are different
there. I was excited to my students but the overall energy isn&amp;#39;t the
same. We&amp;#39;re two weeks in and I still haven&amp;#39;t seen most of my CS
colleagues. In the high school, everyone comes back at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any event. It&amp;#39;s an exciting time in what should be an exciting year
for CS teachers and students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m not going to rehash everything that&amp;#39;s going on since I&amp;#39;m sure most
readers already already know what&amp;#39;s going on but I&amp;#39;ll add one
thing. Many New York teachers need ongoing professional development -
CTLE hours. It seems that teachers in specific programs like New York
City&amp;#39;s Software Engineering Pilot (SEP) have a number of PD
opportunities provided to them and there also seems to be a good
amount of PD at the entry level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be much for the teacher ready for that next
step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To address this, we&amp;#39;ll be offering once a month sessions through
Hunter for CS teachers who are ready to move beyond the basics both in
content and pedagogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The plan is to start some time in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the meantime to all the teachers meeting their students tomorrow -
have a great semester!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Class Rules</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/class-rules/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/class-rules/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Classes started up again today so I thought I&amp;#39;d talk about my class
rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t seem to recall many class rules in college. Sure, there was a
grading policy governing homework and the like but not much beyond
that. In K12 there are usually more. When you can talk, how you set up
your notebook, how to do homework, bathroom policy etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For years, I&amp;#39;ve used the same set of class rules and I always talk
about the rules with my classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t have a lot of rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Just two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;#39;t be a bum and don&amp;#39;t be a jerk&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;img height=100px width=100px  src=&amp;#34;&lt;img src=&#34;https://bamfstyle.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/dude6-main.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;https://bamfstyle.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/dude6-main.jpg&#34; title=&#34;https://bamfstyle.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/dude6-main.jpg&#34; /&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;img height=100 width=100px  src=&amp;#34;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*x6Y-uVduUOWmYngr.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*x6Y-uVduUOWmYngr.jpg&#34; title=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*x6Y-uVduUOWmYngr.jpg&#34; /&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not only are they good class rules, they&amp;#39;re also good life rules. I
tell my classes that if they follow these two rules everything else
takes care of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, what do they mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Being a bum means you&amp;#39;re doing something detrimental to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You don&amp;#39;t hand in an assignment? You&amp;#39;re being a bum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Don&amp;#39;t prepare for an exam? You&amp;#39;re being a bum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Don&amp;#39;t ask for an extension until right before a project&amp;#39;s due because
you didn&amp;#39;t even look at it until the night before? Bum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Being a jerk means you&amp;#39;re doing something detrimental to someone
else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you&amp;#39;re meeting a bunch of friends to see a movie and you leave them
waiting for you on a cold corned February since you can&amp;#39;t bother to be
on time, you&amp;#39;re being a jerk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Don&amp;#39;t hold up your end of a group project? You&amp;#39;re being a jerk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hold up the class by asking the same question that was just asked and
answered, not because you didn&amp;#39;t understand but because you weren&amp;#39;t
listening? You&amp;#39;re being a jerk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have my students fill out an information form at the start of the
semester. I give them a day or two to do it but there is a
deadline. Don&amp;#39;t fill it out on time and you&amp;#39;re being a bum. You&amp;#39;re
also being a jerk. Why? Because I use that list to set up my
grade book as well as mailing lists and other resources. If I don&amp;#39;t
have the data from all my students I either have to wait on setting up
my systems or I have to go back later and manually add the
stragglers. Making more work for the teacher because you couldn&amp;#39;t be
bothered to finish a two minute assignment? That falls under the &amp;#34;jerk&amp;#34; category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Every interaction makes an impression and even small actions can have
effects on people that you don&amp;#39;t realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You do something the right way, people will notice. You do things that adversely affect
people? They&amp;#39;ll notice that as well. I want my students to start to
become aware of how they act, how they affect the people around
them, and the reputations they build through small actions - both
positive and negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We also talk about why I don&amp;#39;t need to hear excuses when you violate
either of these rules. If you do things the right way - you don&amp;#39;t act
like a bum or a jerk - you build your credibility. If at some point
later, something happens - you miss an assignment because a last
minute emergency - you&amp;#39;ve got the positive reputation so you don&amp;#39;t
need an excuse. If you&amp;#39;ve been a bum all along, the excuse carries no
weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
None of this has anything to do with computer science but it does have
to do with our students growth as people so in many ways it&amp;#39;s more
important. Do I make in impact with any of this? I can&amp;#39;t be sure but
I think it&amp;#39;s important enough to make the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Artifacts Have Stories</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/artifacts-have-stories/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/artifacts-have-stories/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Earlier today I was asked about my avatar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/hero-z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/hero-z.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/hero-z.jpg&#34; align=&#34;&#34; center=&#34;&#34; height=&#34;250&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been using it for most services for a few months now. It&amp;#39;s an
image that I&amp;#39;ve had for ages. I started thinking about using it about
a year ago&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, what&amp;#39;s the story?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It was back in 1993. I had just started at Stuy. I taught some CS when
I was at Seward Park but at the time, I was teaching all math at
Stuy. Mostly Geometry to ninth graders but also a smattering of
Algebra 2 / Trig and Linear Algebra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The math department had the fourth floor and some of the third but
since I was the new guy I taught most of my classes in the hinterlands
of the 7th and 8th floor. At least I had great views of the lower
Hudson and the Statue of Liberty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My math classes were somewhat more formulaic and structured than my
computer science classes would end up. Start with a &amp;#34;Do Now&amp;#34; while I
checked homework. Kids then present homework that they put on the
board. We then did the Do Now which hopefully led into the lesson. I
was never super strict but it was pretty structured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In one class I had a young man, let&amp;#39;s call him Charles since I don&amp;#39;t
know if he&amp;#39;s comfortable with my sharing his true identity. He sad in
the last two or three rows right next to the window on the south side
of classroom. Charles would constantly doodle throughout the
class. This never really bothered me. He was always prepared, did well
on all assessments and was also ready and able to take part in class
discussion regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Apparently, his other teachers weren&amp;#39;t as tolerant of his doodling. At
the end of the semester he gave me the picture. and said he really
appreciated me not hassling him about the doodling. I thanked him and
explained that since it didn&amp;#39;t adversely affect his performance (and
might have helped) and didn&amp;#39;t distract anyone else, why would I give
him a hard time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The semester ended and I didn&amp;#39;t think much more about it although once
I got my own office I put the picture in a frame and added it to my
collection of office trinkets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Last year, now at Hunter, I was looking at the picture and I wondered
what ever happened to Charles. I hadn&amp;#39;t seen him after he was in my
class as a freshman. I had started to teach CS and we started to developed our
cult so I didn&amp;#39;t end up keeping in touch with many of my students from
those freshmen math classes.  It turned out I was able to find him on
Facebook. I don&amp;#39;t think he remembered me but he accepted the friend
request and we caught up. His family moved out of NY after his
freshman year so it made even more sense that I never saw him again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I keep the picture because it&amp;#39;s fun and also to remind me of the
circumstances under which I go it. I always appreciate it when a
student takes the time to say thanks even when they don&amp;#39;t remember
anything about the class 30 years later. When I would get little gifts
during the holidays, if I&amp;#39;m being honest, I&amp;#39;ll have to say that I
would frequently throw the gift card or present on the pile but I&amp;#39;d
keep and cherish the notes and letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Over the years, I accumulated quite a collection of esoteric from
former students. From the custom mouse pad with Dave, Spike, Igor, and
Oy on it to the Squirtle from Larry to Orion&amp;#39;s pinhead, every artifact
has a story. They remind me of a person time and place. A connection I
had and in many cases I still have. It also creates a bridge to the
past both for me and my students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been derided for hanging t-shirts donated by former students from
their companies when I had my own classroom at Stuy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/shirts-307.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/shirts-307.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/shirts-307.jpg&#34; align=&#34;&#34; center=&#34;&#34; height=&#34;200&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Those naysayers are wrong. Each shirt has a story. It could be Joy&amp;#39;s
Apple shirt and how she agonized over her employment options, Pawel&amp;#39;s
Google shirt and his adventures going from Bloomberg LP to the French
West Indies to now being a senior programmer at Google or a Digital
Ocean shirt from Ben and Moisey and the stories they evoke are far two
numerous to list. They create a history and perpetuate the
culture. Each has a story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Looking back, I&amp;#39;m glad that I&amp;#39;ve kept many mementos from the
past. The objects are incidental but the stories give context and
inspiration to current students while at the same time reminding me of
my past and my shared journey with so many of my students.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Software Longevity</title>

      <pubDate>Sun, 19 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/software-longevity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Writing about &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/rite-of-passage-projects/#.W3l-fxhKhhE&#34;&gt;old projects&lt;/a&gt; got me thinking of my first programming gig
and software longevity. It was a part time after school / full time
summer job at Arcus-Simplex-Brown. I started in my senior year in high
school and continued through most of my first year in college. It
wasn&amp;#39;t my first job - that was being a delivery boy at &lt;a href=&#34;http://videoroom.net/&#34;&gt;Video Room&lt;/a&gt;, an
independent video store that&amp;#39;s survived from the old VHS/Betamax days
through DVDs and is still, somehow or other, surviving in this day and
age of streaming video. My job at Arcus-Simplex-Brown was my first job
as a programmer. I got it through my buddy Ben who got it from one of
our math teachers at Stuy. Ben had found a job closer to home so
passed this one along to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Arcus-Simplex-Brown was (is?) a ticket printing company&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/nxYAAOSwHUhaGYw3/s-l1600.png&#34; alt=&#34;https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/nxYAAOSwHUhaGYw3/s-l1600.png&#34; title=&#34;https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/nxYAAOSwHUhaGYw3/s-l1600.png&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; height=&#34;100&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c1/f0/ec/c1f0ec2f524c9e3e65c5e8b50fc7226a.png&#34; alt=&#34;https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c1/f0/ec/c1f0ec2f524c9e3e65c5e8b50fc7226a.png&#34; title=&#34;https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c1/f0/ec/c1f0ec2f524c9e3e65c5e8b50fc7226a.png&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; height=&#34;100&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They also did tickets for sporting events like the Knicks and
Rangers at the Garden. More recently, this was 1983, they had started
selling computer printed tickets and that&amp;#39;s where I came in. They had
a dot matrix line printer. Not the small kind used by personal
computer owners and small businesses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&#34;center&#34; height=&#34;100&#34;&gt;[[&lt;img src=&#34;https://global.epson.com/company/corporate_history/milestone_products/img/11_product.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;https://global.epson.com/company/corporate_history/milestone_products/img/11_product.jpg&#34; title=&#34;https://global.epson.com/company/corporate_history/milestone_products/img/11_product.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Printers like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://global.epson.com/company/corporate_history/milestone_products/11_mx80.html&#34;&gt;Epson MX 80&lt;/a&gt; pictured above had a print head that
moved across a line at a time much like a modern desktop ink jet
printer. The difference was that it had a print head that had a matrix
of pins which fired and hit an ink ribbon which left the ink
impression on the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Rather, they had a big heavy duty one where the print head went across
the entire width of the paper and it literally printed a line at a
time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
and a computer attached. I think it was an old &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Star_Computers&#34;&gt;North Star&lt;/a&gt;
computer. It ran &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M&#34;&gt;CP/M&lt;/a&gt; which was like a primitive version of
MS-DOS. 64K of memory  and
two floppy drives. It had a basic interpreter built in and they
also had a basic compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They had a program that was supposed to print the tickets but it
didn&amp;#39;t really work. My first job was to get it working, It was a HUGE
mess of a program. God knows how many lines of BASIC code with a few
gosubs and a ton of gotos. I don&amp;#39;t think there were too many
comments. It didn&amp;#39;t help that in addition to having to deal with
custom theater seating plans and ticket policies you had to know all
sorts of magical incantations to get the printer to do the special
fonts correctly and I don&amp;#39;t recall us having a printer manual so it
all had to be divined from the non-working code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On top of all this, the program was so complex that only the simplest
test cases could be run via the interpreter interactively. Any real
change had to go through the compiler and it took about 40 minutes to
compile the program. Whenever I wanted to take a long break, I set up
a compile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Somehow or other, I got the thing to work. The code started as a mess
and I didn&amp;#39;t improve it any I really had no idea what I was
doing. Still, it did work and we were able to reliably print tickets
for all sorts of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I stopped working at Arcus-Simplex-Brown once I got a job at NYU. That
gig ultimately turned into a full time job which enabled me to work my
way through school. It was the right move but I had a great time and
learned a lot at Arcus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I didn&amp;#39;t think much about the work I did at Arcus over the years. I
finished college, went to Goldman, then some consulting and ultimately
teaching career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One day at Stuy, I noticed this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/arcus-ticket.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/arcus-ticket.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/arcus-ticket.jpg&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; height=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This was now Spring 2012 - almost 30 years later. Judging from the dot
pattern  of the letters it looked like the same printer and was
probably the same program!!!!!!! I couldn&amp;#39;t believe it. Stuy didn&amp;#39;t
use these tickets back in my day so I was really surprised. It looked
like some horrible code I wrote as a kid was still being used
productively almost three decades later!!!!!! They could have
continued to use it because it basically worked or maybe because they
were afraid that touching it would break everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t remember what the code looked like but know it was
horrible. If I had it, I&amp;#39;d be to embarrassed to share and that&amp;#39;s saying
something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The lesson of all this? You never know how long your code is going to
live. It might surprise you. Hopefully in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All the more reason to do better than I did and learn how to do it
right.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
JCS&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://irreal.org/blog/?p=7414#comment-4045190612&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on Irreal today brought me back. It was about &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brief_(text_editor)&#34;&gt;Brief&lt;/a&gt; which
was the editing hotness back in the day. I played with it a little
really mostly used Emacs clones for real work when I was stuck on
MS-DOS systems. Usually either &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JOVE&#34;&gt;JOVE&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsilon_(text_editor)&#34;&gt;Epsilon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the comments Jon reminded me about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MKS_Toolkit&#34;&gt;MKS Toolkit&lt;/a&gt;
which brought most everyday Unix tools to DOS along with a shell and
a version of Vi. I didn&amp;#39;t use Vi much and I only used their shell
until I wrote my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This got me thinking about &amp;#34;rite of passage&amp;#34; projects. I was in
college in the mid to late 80s. It was the heyday of the
IBM-PC. Schools still used older time sharing systems like DEC-20s and
Vaxen but the PC was all the rage. The cool thing about them was that
you had full control and access to the machine and it was simple
enough to get your head around pretty much everything about it. The
downside was that MS-DOS was very limited and of course there was
little to no networking going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the one hand, you could dive into the low level machine language
stuff very easily. Get Norton&amp;#39;s book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7446489-L.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7446489-L.jpg&#34; title=&#34;https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7446489-L.jpg&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; height=&#34;250&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and you&amp;#39;re on your way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand many student&amp;#39;s graduated with no concept of time
sharing and the ramifications of sharing a system or resources were
foreign to many kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even though we always look back to the &amp;#34;good old days,&amp;#34; in many ways
things weren&amp;#39;t much different. I got a very strong background in
academic CS from NYU (Courant Institute) but just like today, there
was no real preparation for the real world.If you wanted to really develop your
coding chops you had to work on side projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I seem to recall, a typical &amp;#34;rite of passage&amp;#34; side project was writing
your own shell. It didn&amp;#39;t have to be anything as powerful as BASH or
ZSH but it would typically be much more powerful than DOS and much
more Unixy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I recall writing my first shell down in UC-49 of Tisch Hall when the
computer labs weren&amp;#39;t busy. I wrote it in C which was what the cool
kids used back then. Specifically I used the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Williams_Company&#34;&gt;Let&amp;#39;s C&lt;/a&gt; compiler from the
Mark Williams company. This was before Turbo C 2.0 so Let&amp;#39;s C was
pretty much the only game in town for a cheap Unix style C compiler
for DOS. There was also Run/C but that was a C interpreter, not a
compiler. I also used that to learn C. Funny story - I certainly
didn&amp;#39;t know this at the time but Run/C was written by Peter
Brooks. Peter and I would later meet when he became my colleague at
Stuyvesant teaching CS and I now have the privilege of being able to
call him friend. I joke that I owe him ~ $100 for the interpreter from
back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since this was on DOS, I couldn&amp;#39;t do real Unix style pipes like
&lt;code&gt;cat file | sort | uniq -c | sort -n&lt;/code&gt; but I did simulate it with redirection and temporary
files. It also supported aliases, simple scripts and I think a few
other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was pretty happy with it and used it for a couple of years. It was
also one of the first substantial programs I wrote. I learned a lot
from doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another &amp;#34;rite of passage&amp;#34; program that was common back then was a
text based window library. Somethig like ncurses that would allow you
to make text based windows and menus on the text only screen. I also
wrote one of these and actually got to use it for a project when I
started working at Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I guess the third &amp;#34;rite of passage&amp;#34; project I remember was writing a C
compiler but that was different because it was for a class. It was a
significant project but the class didn&amp;#39;t really help with writing a
large program in general - it was all about the compiler and all the
theory behind it. Great course but not one in software engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Nowadays the projects have changed. Text based windowing is long gone
and while I still think writing a shell is a useful and rewarding
exercise it&amp;#39;s not scratching an itch the way it did back when we were
stuck on DOS. I guess writing a full stack web app is probably a
pretty typical one for students these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Any others?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Early Code Reuse</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/early-code-reuse/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/early-code-reuse/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been following the tweets coming out of &lt;a href=&#34;https://icer.acm.org/&#34;&gt;ICER2018&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;ve never been
to ICER but now am thinking about trying to get funding to go next
year. One set of tweets involved students writing or using APIs or
Libraries. This overlaps with Owen Astrachan&amp;#39;s talk from this past
year&amp;#39;s CSTA conference on sorting. I was planning on writing a post
about Owen&amp;#39;s talk but I thought I&amp;#39;d leave it for the school year
closer to when sorting is typically covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The points alluded to in the tweets go far deeper than can be
addressed in one blog post and are more suited to the sorting post
I&amp;#39;ll write later on but I thought I&amp;#39;d share a lab that I stole from a
friend of mine years ago to try to get the kids to abstract code into
functions or methods early and to start to think about reusing blocks
of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve talked about abstracting out and reusing code &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/refactoring&#34;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, after
students have covered repetition but this lab
can be done even earlier.  Part of the motivation is the age old
problem of objects / functions / methods early or control structures
early. With o/f/m early kids think about decomposition, layers, and
abstractions but they don&amp;#39;t have the tools to do a whole lot of
interesting things. On the other hand, with control structures early,
kids tend to get in the mindset of throwing everything in &amp;#34;main&amp;#34; at
the top level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This lab tries to get the kids abstracting out and reusing or sharing
code but doesn&amp;#39;t require much more than methods or functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The idea is to create an ASCII art robot or something similar. Of
course, this could also be done in a graphical environment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;example&#34;&gt;

######################
#                    #
#   XX          XX   #
#                    #
#       XXXXX        #
#                    #
######################
###
###
#############
#           #
########           ########
#           #
#           #
#           #
#############
##      ##
##      ##
##      ##
_
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This can easily be done with a series of output instructions or
possibly by building a string with embedded newlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The interesting part comes when you have the student write different
functions for the parts of the robot - the head, body, and legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Students end up with routines like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-java&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and then can generate their robot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-java&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now for the fun part. Students can make a variety of heads, legs, and
bodies. Going further, introduce if statements and random numbers and
they can generate random robots:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-java&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not the most elegant code but this can be done VERY early when the
students don&amp;#39;t know more advanced constructs and techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The class can also share robot &amp;#34;components&amp;#34; as long as there&amp;#39;s a
simple code sharing mechanism - perhaps using &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/&#34;&gt;gists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, this can be revisited if desired later on once the class has
covered more advanced language constructs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Class Communications</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/class-communications/</link>

&lt;p&gt;
Right now I&amp;#39;m on vacation in Harrogate England. Natan  is here taking part in the International Gilbert and Sullivan
Festival so Devorah and I came along as tourists. Today we went to Knaresborough:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/knaresborough.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/knaresborough.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/knaresborough.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500px&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;/&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
The River Nidd as seen from Knaresborough Castle
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Normally when traveling I try to get everything in and that leaves me
pretty exhausted at the end of each day. Since this time we&amp;#39;ll be here
for around two weeks, I&amp;#39;m trying a less hectic pace. Do some touring
along with some rest and relaxation. I actually gave myself the time
to do some recreational reading and just finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Comeback-LeMond-American-Cycling-Legendary-ebook/dp/B075VDQD2W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1533756774&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=the+comeback+de+vise&#34;&gt;The Comeback&lt;/a&gt; by
Daniel de Vise and have a big queue of what&amp;#39;s next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m also going to try to get a blog post or two out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One thing I&amp;#39;ve been meaning to blog about for a while is class
communication and having seen &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/bucknell-hci/how-i-use-slack-in-my-courses-a-3-year-reflection-888c7e742d04&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; the other day, I guess it&amp;#39;s time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the article, Evan Peck talks about his experience using Slack as a
means of class communications and why he likes it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s my take:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Class communication takes many forms. It can be the dissemination of
information such as assignments or announcements, assignment collection,
presenting feedback either on assignments or in general, specific
interactions between the instructor and the students, group
discussions, and cross student interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For sharing and collecting code as well as providing feedback, I like
using &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/sigcse-2017-github-4/&#34;&gt;Git and GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. I use it for homework, projects, sharing class
code - pretty much anything involving code or student work. That
leaves all of the basic communication platforms. The popular ones
include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The schools CMS – Moodle, Blackboard etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piazza or other forum platforms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slack and other chat platforms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook groups&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;old school mail lists&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Blackboard or your school&amp;#39;s CMS
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First up, Blackboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Just no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In my experience, they&amp;#39;re all slow and clunky and usually have an
awkward interface. I&amp;#39;ve always found them hard to navigate and use and
I find little value added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
Piazza and forum software
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://piazza.com/&#34;&gt;Piazza&lt;/a&gt; is a free to use discussion platform. Many schools use
it. Personally, I don&amp;#39;t like Piazza but it does have some good points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Q&amp;amp;A format works pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It allows anonymous posting which is sometimes desirable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can look at participation reports&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TAs or instructors can approve questions and answers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There really is a lot to like about it but it doesn&amp;#39;t work for
me. Personally, I don&amp;#39;t like the interface but that wouldn&amp;#39;t be the
deal breaker for me if my kids liked it. The deal breaker for me is
that kids have to actively go to the site. Yes, they can set their
preferences for alerts but if they don&amp;#39;t and they don&amp;#39;t check the site
regularly they&amp;#39;ll miss things. This is a big deal to me. If I send out
something important I have no idea if or when people will check in on
it. For me personally, it&amp;#39;s yet another site that I have to actively
and regularly check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another interesting thing I learned about Piazza has to do with
students honesty about platforms. Back at Stuy a colleague used Piazza
regularly and was getting good results with it - many active
students. I couldn&amp;#39;t get as much buy in. The teacher told me that the
kids said they really liked the platform. A year or two later, I
surveyed the kids in my class – they were in his and other teachers
the previous year or two. I asked them about platforms they used and
how they felt about them. The results were that they used Facebook
groups on their own (I&amp;#39;ll talk about them later) and used whatever
platform we required because we required it. Even if they said they
liked it, they really didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Last semester I set up a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.discourse.org/&#34;&gt;Discourse&lt;/a&gt; server for HunterCS. Discourse is
another discussion platform. I liked the
fact that I could run the server and had ownership of the data. I also
liked the way the forum software worked in general. On the other hand,
it had similar overall problems as Piazza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-3&#34;&gt;
Slack
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A hot contender and the one that Mr. Peck uses is Slack. It&amp;#39;s a chat
platform. It can be a separate app running on your phone or desktop or
you can use a web interface. It has channels for topics, can thread
discussions, it does alerts well and can integrate with tools like
calendars and GitHub. Just like with Piazza, there&amp;#39;s a lot to like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My problem with Slack is that it&amp;#39;s really for live communication not
asynchronous after hours communication. It works best when you&amp;#39;re
working on something and you have your slack window open, you have a
question so you type it in and get immediate answers. It just doesn&amp;#39;t
seem to work as well when you don&amp;#39;t use it live. You can read the
messages posted since you last checked but it can be really hard to
follow unless people explicitly use the threading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Slack also shares the issue of being another site or application to
use but since it does alerts well it doesn&amp;#39;t bother me as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-4&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-4&#34;&gt;
Facebook groups
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-4&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Facebook groups seem to have been the student go to for a while
now. They create their own teacher/professor free student groups. I
think it&amp;#39;s great that they create resources like this and as I tell
them, it&amp;#39;s important for them to have a forum that&amp;#39;s free from the
teacher&amp;#39;s eyes. I mean, how can they plan that surprise party for me
on the class chatroom that I have access to :-). On the other hand,
Facebook groups have some downsides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not searchable or discoverable. I&amp;#39;ve seen kids only find out about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;them at the end of semesters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, each year a new group is created so no institutional&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;memory develops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the info stays in Facebook&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-5&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-5&#34;&gt;
Mail lists
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-5&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This all brings me to old school mailing lists. I&amp;#39;ve been using them
for decades and I keep coming back to them. Since they&amp;#39;re just email,
no one has to check a separate app or site. Since they&amp;#39;re email, they
support threading. Also as email, they can be public to the list or
private to just one or a few people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Again, they&amp;#39;re not perfect - I can&amp;#39;t easily set up long term
categories or channels like you can with Slack or Piazza and they
don&amp;#39;t integrate with tools like calendars so as with everything else,
there&amp;#39;s always some compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-6&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-6&#34;&gt;
What do you use?
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-6&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think I might try Slack again this semester if the students want to
go for it or maybe discourse. If they don&amp;#39;t want to try those, then
it&amp;#39;ll be back to mailing lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What do all of you use? What are the strong and weak points of your
chosen platform and what would make the ideal platform for class
communication?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Getting Ready To Go Back</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/getting-ready-to-go-back-2018/</link>

      <description>
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s August 3rd and I&amp;#39;ve been giving a lot of thought to the start of
the semester. Normally I wouldn&amp;#39;t think about the Fall term this
early. While I&amp;#39;ve been working on and off since last semester ended, I
don&amp;#39;t officially &amp;#34;go back&amp;#34; until August 23rd with classes starting on
the 27th. The difference is that for the first time in forever we&amp;#39;re
taking a longish trip between now and then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We&amp;#39;re heading over to Harrogate England. We&amp;#39;ve never been but Natan&amp;#39;s
taking part in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gsfestivals.org/&#34;&gt;International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival&lt;/a&gt; so we
figured we&amp;#39;d follow and play tourist while he was rehearsing and
otherwise doing the festival. I&amp;#39;m looking forward to the trip but
don&amp;#39;t expect to get much prep work done while we&amp;#39;re there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, what&amp;#39;s coming this semester?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Classes
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hunter&amp;#39;s honors program has grown big time so I&amp;#39;ll be teaching two
classes instead of one this semester. One section will be our
pre-major CS course and one will be our CS1. I&amp;#39;ve done both before so
I won&amp;#39;t need a lot of advance prep. Besides, I learned long ago that
no matter how much prep you do, everything changes once you get in the
classroom with a new batch of kids. Better just to have starter
material and a direction since everything&amp;#39;s going to change after day
one anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
Teacher Ed stuff
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the teacher education program front, we&amp;#39;ve got to send a few items
back through governance for approval. Instead of having teachers in my
programs take a separate fieldwork course, I integrated it into my
curriculum development course. Another change that we have to make,
believe it or not, is to remove the words &amp;#34;for teachers&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;for
educators&amp;#34; from two of the pure computer science courses in the
program. Fortunately, I&amp;#39;ve done all the prep work needed to get these
going come late August. We&amp;#39;re still planning on starting our first
cohort in the Spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-3&#34;&gt;
Other stuff
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s where a lot of the fun stuff is happening. Like last year, I&amp;#39;m
planning on doing a lot of outreach to high schools to talk about
colleges, tech, and Hunter. The outreach&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/hunter-cs-year-two/&#34;&gt;really made a difference&lt;/a&gt;
but it take a lot of time since it&amp;#39;s all about school visits. I&amp;#39;m
hoping to get to some parents association meetings as well this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m also planning a number of new things for our Hunter CS students
and I&amp;#39;d love to jump on the planning now but these things really have
to wait until the term starts. Here&amp;#39;s some of what&amp;#39;s on tap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A monthly CTLE session for CS teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A monthly tech talk / meetup at Hunter for CS students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding more and more internship opportunities for the kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of open source workshops I&amp;#39;m coordinating with MongoDB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m hoping to work out some workshops for the kids with [[&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.redballoonsecurity.com/][Red&#34;&gt;https://www.redballoonsecurity.com/][Red&lt;/a&gt; Balloon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security]]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a new tech mentoring program I&amp;#39;m hoping to get off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m sure some of these plans will change. I think I&amp;#39;m pretty ready to
go for the fall but I&amp;#39;ll still mull things over for the next few
weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Two Faces of Project Based Learning</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/two-faces-of-pbl/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 28 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/two-faces-of-pbl/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
If one looks at my twitter feed they&amp;#39;ll notice that in addition to CS
Ed, another issue I&amp;#39;m passionate about is school reform or rather
resistance to what is popularly known as and mislabeled as school reform. I&amp;#39;m anti
vouchers, charter schools, high stakes testing and more. One of the
heroes of this resistance is education historian Diane Ravitch. I&amp;#39;m a
big fan of Diane&amp;#39;s and she&amp;#39;s one of the true great champions of public
schools, kids, and teachers. She blogged today about how a superintendent on Long Island &lt;a href=&#34;https://dianeravitch.net/2018/07/27/new-york-district-on-long-island-shows-that-problem-based-curriculum-produces-better-results-than-test-prep/&#34;&gt;replaced test
prep with project based learning&lt;/a&gt;. The post which talks about how this
superintendent improved test results  is worth a read. My only
quibble was that we shouldn&amp;#39;t read anything into the results for a
variety of reasons including the fact that the group of students who
did the project based learning (PBL) units instead of test prep were
self selecting volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of the comments caught my eye:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PBL is just another “student-centered” fad…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
PBL operates on the myth of “transference” perpetuated by non-educators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The comment continues on with a number of good points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why am I writing about it here? Because PBL is a big CS Ed buzzword
and like most buzzwords there&amp;#39;s both truth at the root of the hype and
hype that distorts the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When done right with the right group of kids, project based learning
can be wonderful but it takes a lot of time and effort. You can&amp;#39;t just
set the kids loose to learn. You&amp;#39;ve got to train them to work
together, set up the project, as the teacher, you&amp;#39;ve got to know the
subject so as to know when to guide, when to tell, when to prod, and when to leave
them alone. Doing it right, at least for most students, is certainly
not giving them the instruction sheet and going off the check your
email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, it&amp;#39;s easy to do it wrong. If you&amp;#39;ve got high
performing kids, they&amp;#39;ll figure things out. If you&amp;#39;ve got a few high
performing kids, they can mask the fact that the majority of a group
isn&amp;#39;t getting things. You might have an assignment where a kid figures
out a formula from discovered data and might be able to then use it to
make predictions but there&amp;#39;s a good chance they won&amp;#39;t understand why
it works or it&amp;#39;s root derivation. That&amp;#39;s where we need the teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of the dangers of bad PBL is that it&amp;#39;s sexy. Kids are engaged and
it appears to work - particularly when the teacher doesn&amp;#39;t know the
subject area. This is my great fear whenever I hear things about
teachers being &amp;#34;Lead Learners.&amp;#34; Sure, when you&amp;#39;re a converted
something else teacher moving into CS you won&amp;#39;t know the subject
matter but that has to change over time. I&amp;#39;ve seen enough instances of
cases where teachers never develop their chops and just throw projects
at the kids augmented by scripted curricula or computer driver
content. The kids get through the class or program but are not
prepared for the next class or next level. I&amp;#39;ve seen this with the old
Cisco curriculum, any number of after school and summer programs -
some VERY highly regarded ones and I think we&amp;#39;ll see more and more of
this in states that are pushing CSforAll without developing the
necessary pre and in service programs for their teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Don&amp;#39;t let my last two paragraphs leave you feeling that I&amp;#39;m anti
PBL. I&amp;#39;m not. It&amp;#39;s great when done right and if you have thee time and
resources in your school and classes you should be using it when
appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you want some pointers on how to get going in the right direction with PBL in CS  check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Science-K-12-Imagining-possibilities-ebook/dp/B07DYDXBSH/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1532808363&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=doug+bergman&#34;&gt;this
book&lt;/a&gt; by my buddy Doug Bergman. It&amp;#39;s a great getting started guide by a
great teacher. He&amp;#39;s basically Mr. PBL and he does it right.  If you&amp;#39;re new to CS you&amp;#39;ll still need to learn content
and if you&amp;#39;re new to teaching, you&amp;#39;ll be developing your chops for
your entire career but it&amp;#39;s a great resource to get you and then your
kids started on the journey.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Keyboarding and the Digital Divide</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/keyboarding-dig-divite/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 23 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/keyboarding-dig-divite/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
My friend Adam posted this link to an article on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201803290068.html&#34;&gt;the new digital
divide&lt;/a&gt; the other day. It&amp;#39;s talking about young people who do
everything on the phone so aren&amp;#39;t familiar or comfortable with a
traditional keyboard/mouse computer setup. In the comments there were
some of us who lamented about the term &amp;#34;digital natives&amp;#34; and the idea
that kids these days know all about computers and technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This led me to think about a couple of things. First was a
conversation I had a few years ago with someone who taught lower
grades. I forget if it was upper elementary or middle school. He asked
if his school should continue to teach keyboarding. I thought about it
for a minute and decided it was probably a good thing. At some point,
kids will have to type things - papers, reports, programs and the kid
that doesn&amp;#39;t have to fight with the technology has a clear
advantage. I don&amp;#39;t remember who said this but one of the early
rationales for markup typesetting systems like LaTeX or HTML was that
the system takes care of the formatting so the author could focus on
the content. You shouldn&amp;#39;t stress about how large the type should be,
how to emphasize some text or how to number a section, just say you
want a section, let the system format it and you focus and writing
your content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the case of HTML  you weren&amp;#39;t supposed to worry about the size of
the screen, if it could show graphics, or even if it was color,
grayscale or black and white - you just provided the content and
markup and the browser would render it correctly. Same with LaTeX. You
just labelled your document with things like §ion ⊂seciton,
\footnote \equation etc. and let the system typeset it. If you&amp;#39;re
publishing a book, just say it&amp;#39;s a book and it&amp;#39;ll render it correctly,
a paper, it&amp;#39;ll make the appropriate adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All this meant you could just focus on your content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At a more basic level, the same is true for typing. If you&amp;#39;re hunting
for keys in words you&amp;#39;re distracted from thinking about sentences let
alone concepts, flow, etc. A kid who can type most certainly has an
advantage over one who does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Meanwhile in the schools there&amp;#39;s frequently an assumption that kids
used computers all the time so they certainly can type. In my
experience that hasn&amp;#39;t been the case and as pointed out in the linked
article above things are probably going to get worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course it&amp;#39;s true that typing might eventually go the way of the
dodo. Maybe swiping and tapping with thumbs will become the norm
through society or maybe we&amp;#39;ll go to mostly dictation (although that
has it&amp;#39;s own problems) but we won&amp;#39;t get there for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The article also made me think about the fact that kids these days use
computers all them time and don&amp;#39;t know how to do anything on
them. Almost sounds like a Yogiism. The truth is that, yes, kids grew
up using computers, tablets, and phones but they use them within the
walled silos of Facebook, snapchat etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back in the day, if you used computers you had to make an effort. If
you wanted to use a word processor you had to learn something about a
file system. If you wanted to do something on that new fangled thing
called the internet, you had to learn something about HTML and
transferring files. In general, if you were a teacher and a kid used a
computer for something they were probably pretty knowledgable about
computers and if they didn&amp;#39;t know something they could probably figure
it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, everything is within a pre provided application. Kids can use
Google Docs or I&amp;#39;d guess Microsoft Office and have no idea what a file
system is. They put up pictures using Instagram, commuincate using
Facebook or Snapchat and in general don&amp;#39;t have to know anything about
the technology they&amp;#39;re using. Some argue that CS Education should
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rushkoff.com/books/program-or-be-programmed/&#34;&gt;address this&lt;/a&gt; but then we turn around and use integrated cloud based
environments so the kids learn some of the algorithmic side of
programming but nothing about the environment they&amp;#39;re working in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Personally, I think our kids should ahve at least a rudimentary
understanding of what&amp;#39;s under the hood but I could be wrong. I try to
address this by starting the kids in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/&#34;&gt;sheltered environments&lt;/a&gt; and then
graduate them up to the command line but that&amp;#39;s just me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The important takeaway is to remember that a &amp;#34;digital native&amp;#34; may very
know nothing about the technology that they&amp;#39;re using. We should
understand that and act accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Time To Create An Ethics Course</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/time-to-create-an-ethics-course/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 21 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/time-to-create-an-ethics-course/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I think it&amp;#39;s time for me to start developing a CS Ethics class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An ethics course isn&amp;#39;t a replacement for having teachers that live and
model good behavior and weave ethical issues throughout the curriculum
but still, adding a separate course on top of that has its merits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m not in a rush to create this course. I might be done in a month or
it might take a couple of years. When I&amp;#39;m done, I&amp;#39;ll add it as an
option in my CS Teacher education programs but hopefully it will be an
attractive course for undergrad CS majors as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While it&amp;#39;s easy enough to come up with possible topics - privacy,
moral responsibilities, biased algorithms, net neutrality and on and
on I&amp;#39;m looking for this course to have a serious coding component. I
want the students to build things to really understand the
implications of what they&amp;#39;re studying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One topic I definitely want to cover is &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/10/youre-not-so-anonymous/&#34;&gt;anonimity&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;d love to find
the right combination of data sets and have the class discover that
some hidden information in the sets isn&amp;#39;t nearly as hidden as it seems
to be. When I was at Stuy, I was thinking about
having the kids give me permission to use their class schedules since
even with names removed we could probably identify many kids by
electives and overlapping classes. I have no idea what I&amp;#39;ll be able to
do at Hunter. If I can come up with something good I think this will
form the basis of a pretty amazing part of the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another project I&amp;#39;d love to put together is something dealing with a
biased algorithm. Again, I don&amp;#39;t know where this will go, maybe
something where I can seed the class so that different groups
implement some project differently and we can then analyze each groups
biases, hidden or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Beyond these two, I&amp;#39;m not sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How about you? Anyone out there have any good ideas for programming
projects for an ethical CS course? If so, please share. It might be a
while but when I do finish putting this together I&amp;#39;ll be sure to
publish whatever the end result is.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A couple of Brian Kernighan videos</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/brian-kernighan-videos/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/brian-kernighan-videos/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I noticed a couple of short videos - interviews with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan&#34;&gt;Brian Kernighan&lt;/a&gt; -
on my YouTube home page the other day. This is probably because I
recently viewed a Kernighan video in the same series after reading
&lt;a href=&#34;http://irreal.org/blog/?p=7327%0A&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; post on the history of naming grep on JCS&amp;#39;s blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For you youngsters out there, CS people of my generation relied on
Brian&amp;#39;s books &amp;#34;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language&#34;&gt;The C Programming Language&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unix_Programming_Environment&#34;&gt;The Unix Programming
Environment&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#34;to get us started with C and Unix respectively.  Even
though they were both published in the 1970s I&amp;#39;d still consider the
both as &amp;#34;must reads.&amp;#34; The section on software development at the end
if the Unix book is still probably one of the best written
introductions to compilers out there. I&amp;#39;d also add a few more books he
co-authored to the &amp;#34;must read&amp;#34; list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Programming_Style&#34;&gt;The Elements of Programmign Style&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Software-Tools-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/020103669X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1532118607&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=software+tools&#34;&gt;Software Tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Practice_of_Programming&#34;&gt;The Practice of Programming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and I&amp;#39;d even say &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_AWK_Programming_Language&#34;&gt;The AWK Programming Language&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read these books in the 80s, 90s and post 2000 so even when reading
examples using ancient Fortran, the concepts still hold up and the
writing is extremely accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My Brian Kernighan story is that way back in the mid 1990s when I was
starting to design what would become Stuyvesant&amp;#39;s intro CS course, I
sent out emails to as many &amp;#34;thought leaders&amp;#34; as I could get a hold of
including both professionals and academics. I cold-emailed Brian based
on a conversation I had with a former student. My former student,
Bruce, had wandered into Brian&amp;#39;s office while in college for &amp;#34;office
hours&amp;#34; on a lark and ended up having a great conversation. He felt
Brian might respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I shot off an email and a few days later got back pages and pages of
really useful thoughts and commentary. I was blown away by the
response. Either he took some serious time to think this out and
respond to some nobody teacher cold-emailing him or he&amp;#39;s just that
good that he can rattle off a tome length response to some random
teacher emailing him. Either way, it was a huge help. It also made an
impression so while I might fail at times, I try to be responsive when
people cold call or otherwise ask for help that I can provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I met Brian a number of years later at Google and in addition to being
tolerant of my fanboy-ing, I found him to just a really special
individual&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Both these videos are short and I think both CS students and teachers
will find them very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How early for APCS</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/how-early-apcs/</link>

      <description>
&lt;p&gt;
In what grade should students take APCS? This question comes up from
time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve heard answers ranging from middle school through never. Infact,
years ago, my chairman relayed a conversation he had with Marvin
Minsky where he asked Minsky what the high schools should be teaching
with respect to CS. The answer was &amp;#34;nothing.&amp;#34; This was then amended to
&amp;#34;teach them to type.&amp;#34; Of course this was a long time ago but I believe
the sentiment was that college was the right time and the high schools
don&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;re doing and will just screw up the
kids. Actually, I still see some of this attitude today and it gets
passed down where high school teachers sometimes don&amp;#39;t want the
middle schools to &amp;#34;mess up their kids&amp;#34; and on down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At this point, it&amp;#39;s pretty clear that you can do good CS at the high
school level and as things are being pushed down the grades we&amp;#39;ll
eventually figure out what&amp;#39;s right and when.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Still, within the high school the question of what grade for APCS-A
remains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There isn&amp;#39;t a single right answer for this but I can share
my experience and what I ended up deciding when I developed things at
Stuy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
MATH BOOKS and Physics First
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As parents, my wife and I learned early on that we&amp;#39;d have to
supplement what our kids would learn in school, particularly in terms
of math and science. I was in charge of math. Since I used assorted
books to help, math time came to be known simply as &amp;#34;MATH BOOKS.&amp;#34; It&amp;#39;s
funny that now while my kids don&amp;#39;t look back super fondly on MATH BOOKS
they agree that it was an important thing for us to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I discovered, as I&amp;#39;m sure many parents do, that there are times when a
kid is just not ready for a subject. At one point I tried to introduce
Algebra too early and saw it wasn&amp;#39;t going to take so I pulled back. A
while later, we tried again. This time it was clear that they could do
the mechanics and solve problems based on rules and formulae but they
really didn&amp;#39;t &amp;#34;get it.&amp;#34; A third attempt some time later, they were
ready. They mastered the subject with deep understanding easily. It
could be argued that the early exposure helped but I don&amp;#39;t think it
did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The takeaway here is that kids can do the mechanics and appear to
succeed but if it&amp;#39;s too early, they don&amp;#39;t really learn the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I saw this on a larger scale with &amp;#34;Physics First.&amp;#34; At Stuy, most
freshmen would take Bio in 9th grade followed by Chem and then Physics
in their Junior year. Physics first kids would take Physics in the 9th
grade. I don&amp;#39;t have any evidence for this but based on my inquiries
over the years it seemed that the kids who took physics in their
junior year had a deeper understanding of the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also personally saw this when teaching math classes early on in my
career. Most Stuy freshmen take geometry. The math aces take
precalc or calc but a few weren&amp;#39;t math aces but were the star in their
middle school. They were pushed through geometry in 8th  grade and
started Stuy in Algebra 2 and Trig. The majority of these kids that I
taught could spit back all the formulas and theorems from geometry but
very few were actually ready for Alg2/Trig and struggled
considerably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
APCS
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So what about APCS? At Stuy we always taught a superset of the old
APCS-AB. It&amp;#39;s mostly APCS-A in the Fall semester and Data Structures
in the Spring. When I started, there was no prerequisite for APCS so I
had students in all grades. Mostly Juniors and Seniors but a few
Sophomores. I think I only had a freshman in APCS once and they were
an outlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some of my sophomores were ready, more could merely spit back material
and do the mechanics - enough to pass the APCS-AB exam but they really
didn&amp;#39;t get it. There were some, however that weren&amp;#39;t ready. These were
very bright kids and while I can&amp;#39;t say for sure, deep down I very much
suspect that if they took my class a year later they would have done
much better and they might have followed a very different path towards
their future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a teachers we can change lives for the better and in fact save
lives. We can also do great damage. Because of the latter, teachers
should follow the mantra &amp;#34;first do no harm.&amp;#34; This led me to a general
rule of taking kids into APCS-AB until their junior year. If I were to
allow a sophomore in I wanted to be pretty sure that the kid was
ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Later we were able to create a sophomore year CS requirement which
gave all kids exposure to CS prior to APCS-A (we still taught AB but
by now only the A exam was offered) and also gave us a platform to vet
the outliers who might be ready for APCS. For those kids, in addition
to an interview we had them self study APCS-A, do a project and sit
for the APCS-A final exam and then we&amp;#39;d add them to the second half of
our AP class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-3&#34;&gt;
Has it worked?
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By and large the system has worked. Kids now get an intro in the 10th
grade followed by APCS in 11 and more electives if desired in the
12th. For the kid that&amp;#39;s truly ready for APCS in the 10th grade, we
have a path. We don&amp;#39;t make it easy but the path is there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Over the years we&amp;#39;ve had some CS superstars come through the
program. Some have pushed back – &amp;#34;why do I have to take the intro?&amp;#34;
&amp;#34;Why can&amp;#39;t i start right away in APCS?&amp;#34; – after all was said and
done, all but one came back to say that we did it the right way and
that they benefited from all our classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At Stuy, it seems that for most students, 11th grade is right for our
APCS. Between academic maturity, other classes, scheduling and
everything else, it seems that this works the best for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-4&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-4&#34;&gt;
Why the rush?
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-4&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Frequently the question as to when to teach APCS revolves around how
early it can be taught. I have to ask - why are we so caught up with
doing things so early?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we&amp;#39;re just pushing college level courses down to high school then
what&amp;#39;s the point? The kids will have to take the classes again if
they&amp;#39;re going to major in CS anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you have a program that doesn&amp;#39;t duplicate college courses you might
want to have kids finish APCS-A earlier but I wonder how early you
really need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a society we keep pushing things down younger and younger. We&amp;#39;re
pushing AP classes like history or APCS-P down to 10th grade or even
earlier. You have to ask, is a course that&amp;#39;s developmentally
appropriate for a 18-22 year old developmentally appropriate for a 14
or 15 year old? Probably not. You also have to ask that if it makes
more sense to push further ahead or if it&amp;#39;s better to do enrichment at
a level the kids can handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m an enrichment over acceleration guy but other people differ. Just
like the question of when for APCS, there&amp;#39;s probably not a single
right answer to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-5&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-5&#34;&gt;
Last words and what should you do?
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-5&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I said up front, there&amp;#39;s no right answer to this. I&amp;#39;m still
convinced that 11th grade is probably the best general entry point for
APCS-AB but if I were only teaching APCS-A maybe I&amp;#39;d shift it down a
year. My gut tells me no, partially based on teaching non APCS to 8th,
9th, and 10th graders but maybe. Of course, we all teach different
students in different environments so your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are also those outlier kids that can truly master the subject at
an earlier age, I&amp;#39;m not really considering them here but they should
be accommodated when possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you&amp;#39;ve been running a program for a while, look at the data - not
how many kids pass the exam - look at how many master the next level
material. If your kids next class is data structures in college, find
out how well prepared they were and see if and how it maps to the
grade in which they took APCS. If you&amp;#39;re just starting, I&amp;#39;d recommend
erring on the side of caution - remember &amp;#34;do no harm.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you have to teach CS and it turns out you have to teach it when the
kids are too young to master APCS-A then don&amp;#39;t teach APCS-A, teach
great CS at a level that&amp;#39;s appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All of this will work itself out in time. Until we get there, there
will be some mis-steps - I know I&amp;#39;ve had mine. As long
as we continue to move the kids forward and give them something that they
wouldn&amp;#39;t have been getting otherwise while we figure all this out,
we&amp;#39;re doing pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>CSTA 2018 - Funding and Direction</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/csta-2018-future/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/csta-2018-future/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
In addition to everything I wrote about last time there were a couple
of other big announcements at this year&amp;#39;s CSTA conference. Both
announcements deal with funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, there is a new class of CSTA membership. The free tier remains
but now for $50 you can join &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.csteachers.org/page/cstaplus&#34;&gt;CSTA+&lt;/a&gt;. This new level of membership comes
with a bunch of extras that are probably good for K12 teachers but I
doubt I&amp;#39;ll use any of them. I did, however, get a snazzy CSTA+ water
bottle by joining at the conference. For me the interesting part is
that 50% of CSTA+ dues will go to support local chapters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t exactly know what that means but it&amp;#39;s what got me to
join. Ultimately, local teaching communities are important and CSTA+
supports that, I&amp;#39;m all in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That said, what do chapters do? I know what goes on in NY but not
elsewhere. I bet the same is true for people all over the country. One
question that came up repeatedly at the conference, at least in my
circles was &amp;#34;what would the chapters use the money for?&amp;#34; I think it
would be wonderful if on the CSTA web site there was a page where
chapters could easily list activities funded by the central
organization. I&amp;#39;m not looking for a big write up - who has time to
read or write that. I&amp;#39;m looking for a line or two. What the chapter
did and maybe a few comments on details. Over time this could be  a
great way for chapters to steal ideas from each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The other piece of big news was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/new-partnership-support-computer-science-teachers-mary-snapp-1c/?published=&#34;&gt;Microsoft pledging a big chunk of
change to the CSTA&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;ve often lamented that so many CS Education (and
education decisions in general) are decided by everyone except the
teachers. The CSTA is our teacher&amp;#39;s professional organization and our
best bet for teacher representation when policy is made and
implemented. Once again it appears that some of these funds will help
support local chapters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Microsoft funding though got me thinking. The linked piece talks
about advocacy, professional development and curriculum. All important but
there&amp;#39;s an even greater need right around the corner. We need quality,
qualified CS teachers and we need them now. Taking a teacher with no
CS background and giving them some PD can be a stop gap but it isn&amp;#39;t a
solution. Long term we need pre and in service teacher preparation
programs similar to what we&amp;#39;re rolling out at Hunter. Programs that
include both pedagogy and content. As states begin to require these
programs, as they do in all other subject areas, teachers both new and
in service will have to take a number of graduate credits. In our
case, 18 for a certificate for an already licensed teacher and our MA
program is somewhere in the 30s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;d love to see money allocated to pay for CS teacher certification
through our public colleges as they (we) roll out programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This said, the Microsoft commitment is great news for the CSTA and
CSTA is a great option for teachers that can afford it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here in NY, our CSTA chapter is fairly young. I&amp;#39;m excited to see what
this year brings both on the local and national level.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Csta 2018 Report</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/csta-2018-report/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/csta-2018-report/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I just got back from the CSTA (Computer Science Teacher&amp;#39;s Association)
conference. It&amp;#39;s the biggest annual conference dedicated to K12 CS
education. I think there were about 700 people attending. It felt much
larger than last year but compared to SIGCSE which is double the size,
CSTA still felt pretty intimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The conference was in Omaha Devorah came along to play tourist and we both
came a day early to do some site seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, we hit the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.omahazoo.com/&#34;&gt;zoo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lauritzengardens.org/&#34;&gt;Lauritzen Gardens&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#39;ve got the Bronx Zoo
here in NY an the NY and Brooklyn Botanical Gardens which are all
pretty impressive but even so, Omaha&amp;#39;s zoo and gardens are well worth
a visit. We then went over to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://durhammuseum.org/&#34;&gt;Durham Museum&lt;/a&gt; which was really
terrific. Housed in an old railroad station, the museum has lots of
great Omaha history as well as trains and other neat exhibits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We also walked all over and did our best to pick up on the local
flavor. One of our discoveries was a terrifically quirky
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.omahanostalgia.com/&#34;&gt;retro/nostalgia/antiques&lt;/a&gt; store. It had an awesome working Pinball
museum&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;file:/img/csta-2018/pinball.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;file:/img/csta-2018/pinball.jpg&#34; title=&#34;file:/img/csta-2018/pinball.jpg&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
along with all the rubber ducks you&amp;#39;d ever want for debugging&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;file:/img/csta-2018/ducks.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;file:/img/csta-2018/ducks.jpg&#34; title=&#34;file:/img/csta-2018/ducks.jpg&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and a whole lot more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By the river, we found both a statue and series of plaques honoring
labor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;file:/img/csta-2018/labor.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;file:/img/csta-2018/labor.jpg&#34; title=&#34;file:/img/csta-2018/labor.jpg&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
something I&amp;#39;m thinking a lot about now in light of the recent Janus
decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As for the conference. It was 100% worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I spent a lot of time at the GitHub booth with my new friend  &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/JohnPhamous&#34;&gt;John&lt;/a&gt;
talking about how I use GitHub with my classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;file:/img/csta-2018/git.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;file:/img/csta-2018/git.jpg&#34; title=&#34;file:/img/csta-2018/git.jpg&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and as always one of the highlights was spending time with old friends
and making new friends while talking shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also gave a talk on the state of CS teacher certification in New
York State and what we&amp;#39;re rolling out at Hunter. that led to
discussions with people from all over. Texas, California, Indiana, and
other places. We had some great discussions as to what&amp;#39;s going on all
over the country. I also had a chance to talk to teachers from all
over NY State to let them know how Hunter can help them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There were also interesting sessions. I attended a BOF facilitated by
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Todd_Lash&#34;&gt;Todd Lash&lt;/a&gt; and others about mapping model lessons to CS standards. I&amp;#39;m
actually not a fan of &amp;#34;the standards&amp;#34; and have some serious concerns
about how standards are thrown around and used but it was a very
interesting session nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also enjoyed a session by Owen Astrachan on teaching sorting. Owen
gives a great talk. I didn&amp;#39;t agree with some of how he approaches
teaching sorting but then we teach different classes and students and
could have slightly different goals leading to my view. In any case, it was very
interesting and I plan on  stealing the motivation he used. Owen
started with a list of top hits - their titles and artist names and
had us perform some mini data mining exercises on them in a
spreadsheet to motivate the concept of sorting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Probably the highlight of the conference for me was &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mfh?lang=en&#34;&gt;Michelle Friend&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s
keynote. She had me as soon as she encouraged us to question the value
of a lot of the education research out there. It got better when she
reminded the audience of teachers that they &lt;strong&gt;were&lt;/strong&gt; all education
researchers. they perform their practice every day, analyze the
results, and work to improve. So often, I hear education researchers
dismiss teachers - &amp;#34;that&amp;#39;s just anecdotal&amp;#34; they say while they
publish the &amp;#34;true way&amp;#34; while ignoring the thousands of complex factors
that actually affect education. There is some research that&amp;#39;s great
and some researchers I greatly respect but I&amp;#39;ve been forced to read
enough bunk and there&amp;#39;s been enough nonsense forced upon teachers over
the years that just doesn&amp;#39;t work in practice that a healthy dose of
skepticism is critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Michelle also talked about assessment and how we test &amp;#34;what we can&amp;#34;
rather than what we should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It wasn&amp;#39;t a talk from on high but I think it&amp;#39;s what the audience
needed - a talk from someone who&amp;#39;s currently an academic but who at
her core, I think is a teacher. It was teacher to teacher and that&amp;#39;s
what, at least in my opinion CSTA should be about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A final highlight for me was when they awarded the Cutler Bell price
for high school students. I knew that Benjamin Spector &amp;amp; Michael
Truell were winners but I didn&amp;#39;t realize they&amp;#39;d be at the conference
to receive their award for their work  creating &lt;a href=&#34;https://halite.io/&#34;&gt;Halite&lt;/a&gt;. I had helped
them a bit along the way so knew the quality and impact of the project
and it was great to see Ben and Mike recognized and to be there to be
able to congratulate them in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now it&amp;#39;s back home and back to reality. The organizing committee
really outdid themselves this year. Great job on CSTA 2018. I&amp;#39;m
already looking forward to next year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I&#39;m not going to congratulate you on your AP results</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ap-2018/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
While busy finishing off my sides for my talk at CSTA2018 this weekend
I noticed a Facebook post about APCS exam grades now or shortly being
available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m no longer teaching high school but still fancy myself a teacher
first and part of the K12CS community. We&amp;#39;re a growing community and
we&amp;#39;re growing fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Usually, at this time of year we see a number of people posting their
results. &amp;#34;I had 16 test takers, had 5 fives, 6 fours etc.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I decided that not only won&amp;#39;t I be congratulating anyone on their
results this year but decided to write this quick post to say no one
should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m not saying that hundreds of teachers out there don&amp;#39;t deserve
congratulations - they do. The problem is, for everyone who&amp;#39;s kids
got all fours and fives, somewhere out there was a teacher who
possibly through no fault of their own had students scoring ones, twos
and threes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I was at Stuy, almost all of my kids got fours or fives when the
exam was the old AB exam. When it went to A only, it was almost
exclusively fives with a few fours and maybe a single one. That wasn&amp;#39;t
me. It was the kids. The AP CS teacher before me got similar results
as did all of my colleagues and the teachers who are still
there. Again, it was the kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That&amp;#39;s not to say that I didn&amp;#39;t add value. I know I spent a career at
Stuy doing right by those kids regardless of test scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The fact is that there&amp;#39;s only so much a teacher can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was APCS (A or principles) their first course?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What other demands are placed on the students?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about the teacher?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many kids in a class? How much time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is APCS an elective or required??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the teacher getting the support they need?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the list goes on. I know some great teachers who never had classes
with great AP results and meh teachers that did. Actually, I know some
APCS and Calc teachers that consistently had classes with good scores
through drill and kill and building student speed. Of course, at the
same time these teachers totally turned the kids off from the subjects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Our teachers do deserve praise and congratulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praise for getting through another year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praise for forging a path in this new subject area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praise for doing more with less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praise for inspiring kids and starting them on a path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praise for changing lives for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your kids left with more than they came in with you did a great job
and deserve congratulations. If you set a seed that will later grow
you&amp;#39;ve done an enormous amount of good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s like I would always tell my kids when they won an award. I was
never proud of them actually winning the award. I was proud of how they carried
themselves, prepared, performed or whatever. The award was just some
outsider also noticing they&amp;#39;re awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Same thing here so I won&amp;#39;t be congratulating teachers on student test
results. The results coming in do provide some measure of closure for
the year though so I will congratulate you all on the year and your
work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hope to see many of you this weekend at CSTA2018.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Certification The Old Way</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/certification-the-old-way/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/certification-the-old-way/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve taken part in a few conversations and read more than a few
threads on teacher certification exams recently. Specifically, CS
teacher certification exams. There are a bunch of them floating
around. There&amp;#39;s the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ets.org/praxis/prepare/materials/5651%0A&#34;&gt;Praxis&lt;/a&gt; offered by ETS, the one from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nestest.com/TestView.aspx?f=HTML_FRAG/NT315_PrepMaterials.html%0A&#34;&gt;National
Evaluation Series&lt;/a&gt;,  the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.west.nesinc.com/TestView.aspx?f=HTML_FRAG/WA073_PrepMaterials.html&#34;&gt;Washington Evaluator Test Series&lt;/a&gt; one and then
there&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.weteachcs.org/&#34;&gt;going on in Texas&lt;/a&gt;. NY State says it will eventually
develop their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have mixed feelings about exams like these. From what I&amp;#39;ve seen some
of the content seems fine and the &amp;#34;stuff you have to know for the
test&amp;#34; isn&amp;#39;t necessarily the worst in the world. As a one time
gatekeeper, I&amp;#39;m not necessarily happy with them but they can provide a
test for a basic threshold of knowledge with out too much focus on
test prep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, they&amp;#39;re just the tip of the iceberg, many states including
New York make their teacher candidates also take other exams. In NY
candidates must take the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dianeravitch.net/2013/06/03/what-is-edtpa-and-why-do-critics-dislike-it/&#34;&gt;edTPA&lt;/a&gt; which is expensive for the teacher
candidate but a big money maker for Pearsons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All of this came out of NCLB back in the day which also created
requirements like &amp;#34;must complete an approved program&amp;#34; as opposed to
just accruing a bunch of relevant education and content credits which
in turn led to more courses like &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/math-for-math-teachers/&#34;&gt;Math for Math Teachers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For you youngsters out there (which I guess is most of you), I thought
I&amp;#39;d share what it was like back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back then, New York City certified it&amp;#39;s own teachers as opposed
to now when everything&amp;#39;s done directly through the state. The system
was, in my opinion far superior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I came in as a career changer - I was doing computer work at the
time - and I came in as a math teacher since there was no CS. Since
math was an area of need it was a little easier for me to get my foot
in the door than it would have been for say an English teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To start I went down to the Board of Education in Brooklyn armed with
my college transcript and waited in line. I then met with someone who
evaluated my transcript. Normally, to get started, I would have needed
a certain number of education credits and a certain number of content
(math) credits. I think the magic number was 24 for the content. Since
math was an area of needed you could get started with a TPD license
(Temporary Per Diem) which required no education credits going in. You
had to get 18 graduate education credits within the first, I think two
years and take the National Teacher Exam. You also got one period off
to be mentored which was a pretty sweet deal. Of course it wouldn&amp;#39;t be
that simple. I only had 16 math credits so fell short but the
evaluator decided to give me credit for a couple of my more mathy CS
classes like Algorithms to get me over the hump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I then went to another line to get a brief mini physical and at some
point I was fingerprinted and I had my TPD. The BOE then ran a one
week &amp;#34;learn to teach&amp;#34; bootcamp and I was left to find my own job which
I was fortunately able to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, I had my foot in the door but as a TPD I had no job protections. I
was observed at least 6 times a year and could be fired at will. In
fact, TPD&amp;#39;s were annually given pink slips in the spring and had to be
rehired again in the Fall if their schools wanted them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I got my 18 education credits over the next two years and took the NTE
which was both the easiest and hardest exam I ever had to
take. Easiest content wise but hard because it was a FULL DAY of non
stop writing and my hand was cramped up into a club by days end. That
got me to the next level - the PPT - Preparatory Provisional License,
I think.  This allowed me to be appointed. Once appointed you had job
retention and seniority rights. Not tenure, but a step closer and you
did get some legit job protections. If you started the process with
education credits to go along with content credits you could have
started directly with the PPT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The final step to get that appointment with the PPT is that you had to
go for an interview with the &lt;strong&gt;Board of Examiners&lt;/strong&gt;. This was the good
part. After work one day I went down to Brooklyn Tech, waited my turn
and then was ushered into a classroom. A typical panel would have a
principal, an assistant principal in your subject area, and a couple
of teachers, again in your subject area. They could grill you on
anything they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They could ask you general teaching questions (usually cached in a scenario):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;how do yo u handle a mixed level class,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;how do you handle a disruptive student&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preparation questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;how would you motivate a  class on the Pythagorean Theorem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would you turn a lesson on solving quadratics in to a hands on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;lab experience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
or content questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;solve this calculus problem…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derive this theorem…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t remember how long the session lasted but afterwards I left and
a couple of weeks later, I had my PPT and was appointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There were a couple of last steps - tenure, which pretty much just
happened since my AP and Principal were both happy with my performance
and I had to get my Masters. Back then you could get a Masters in
anything so I decided to get it in CS rather than Education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There was a lot to like about the old system. I&amp;#39;ve never been a big
fan of a lot of the education credits one has to get and while I still
needed a number of them, I&amp;#39;m glad I had the option to take mostly
content credits. I also like what amounted to being evaluated face to
face by an individual rather than an amorphous bureaucracy. I also
loved the mentoring I got but while the system gave me the class
relief time to allow it to happen I think much of the value was due to
my colleagues at Seward Park High School without whom I would have
washed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The biggest thing I liked was the Board of Examiners. I found it
somewhat stressful since I was never a math guy but the idea that
you&amp;#39;ve got to prove yourself to a bunch of local city educators was
HUGE. You weren&amp;#39;t expected to give the &amp;#34;correct for the test&amp;#34; answer,
you had to convince people that you might have to work for or with
that you got the goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m sure we&amp;#39;ll never go back to the old days but I thought the current
generation might be interested in hearing what it was like back in the
day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Talking about CS teacher certification at CSTA 2018</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/csta-2018/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/csta-2018/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
As I mentioned in my last post, this coming weekend is the Computer
Science Teachers Association (CSTA) conference. I&amp;#39;ve been a member of
CSTA since the beginning but this will be only the second time I&amp;#39;ve
made it to the annual conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The CSTA conference might be the largest conference specifically for
k12 computer science teachers and that makes it different from
conferences like SIGCSE which is for CS education and education
research at all levels or ISTE which seems to be more of an Ed Tech
conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I really enjoyed the conference last year but as the sessions seemed
to be weighted towards beginning CS teachers and towards the CSTA
standards I found most of the value in the &amp;#34;hallway track&amp;#34; when I got
to meet and chat with CS teachers from all over the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Glancing at the program, there looks to be a bunch of interesting
sessions and this time more sessions that I think I&amp;#39;ll personally be
interested in .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m also giving a talk. New York State just approved and created K12
Computer Science Teacher Certification and we&amp;#39;re currently making
plans to roll out our Masters and Certificate programs for CS teachers
as soon as we get state approval. The Masters program will be largely
for preservice teacher candidates and the certificate program for in
service teachers certified in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The talk will cover a bit of the history of CS Education in New York,
what the state is doing and mostly what where building at Hunter and
why. It should be a fun talk. I&amp;#39;m hoping for some people from other
states attend so we can have a rich discussion during the session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, if you&amp;#39;re going to be at the CSTA conference, I&amp;#39;d love to see
you either at my session or at the conference in general. I&amp;#39;ll be
spending most of my non session time there with my friends at GitHub
education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For those of you can&amp;#39;t make it, I hope to blog about the weekend and I
hope others do as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Emacs Episode 50 - presentations</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-50-presentations/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 30 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-50-presentations/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Next weekend I&amp;#39;ll be attending the Computer Science Teachers
Association&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.csteachers.org/general/custom.asp?page=2018Conference&#34;&gt;annual conference.&lt;/a&gt; It&amp;#39;s probably the biggest conference
focussed on K12 Computer Science education. This year, in addition to
attending, I&amp;#39;ll be giving a talk on preservice and inservice CS
teacher preparation programs. I&amp;#39;ll be talking about the new New York
State certification requirements along with what we&amp;#39;re rolling out at
Hunter College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This means putting together a slide deck for the session. When I have
to work collaboratively with non-Emacs users, I will usually go to
Google Docs for presentations. It works and the collaborative aspects
are nice but tools like Google Docs and Powerpoint are designed around
composing slides manually. I much prefer to use a tool where I can
focus on writing my presentation and have the tool turn it into a
presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Org-mode is of course the ideal tool. As an outliner, it lends itself
to organizing a talk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-org&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-org&#34; data-lang=&#34;org&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-org&#34; data-lang=&#34;org&#34;&gt;,* topic 1
the content for slide one
,* topic 2
the content for slide two
,* topic 3
etc.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I can embed code, tables, images, and more. I can also cycle
visibility so I can focus on individual sections. Org-mode also has a
number of export options to take a plain org file which is just ascii
with markup and export it as a presentation. In the video, I&amp;#39;ll take a
quick look at &lt;code&gt;ox-beamer&lt;/code&gt;, which exports to a Beamer presentation in LaTeX and then a PDF,
&lt;code&gt;epresent&lt;/code&gt; which presents right in Emacs and finally &lt;code&gt;ox-reveal&lt;/code&gt; wich
creates a &lt;code&gt;reveal.js&lt;/code&gt; presentation. I ultimately decide to continue to
use &lt;code&gt;ox-reveal&lt;/code&gt; as it&amp;#39;s pretty simple and flexible and I can also directly serve
the final presentation from my own laptop, a usb drive, or directly
from GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Check out the video to see how. If you want more information on using
&lt;code&gt;ox-reveal&lt;/code&gt; check out my earlier &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-11-reveal&#34;&gt;Using Emacs post and video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hunter CS - a lot of progress in a short time</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/hunter-cs-year-two/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/hunter-cs-year-two/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday I was back on campus for an early orientation session for
Hunter&amp;#39;s incoming Daedalus CS honors students. It was the first time
all of us got to meet face to face. The students I met with will be
my third cohort. I got to thinking how far we&amp;#39;ve come in under three
years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hunter&amp;#39;s had a strong but little known undergraduate
CS program for as long as I&amp;#39;ve known. Much like any program, we&amp;#39;ve got
our strengths and weaknesses but you go through our program and
academically you&amp;#39;ll be as well prepared as from anywhere else. We have some
challenges being a commuter school, a liberal arts school and a school
not commonly thought of for CS but the core has always been there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hunter has been making a concerted effort to up its computer science
game and my joining the team has been part of that. The Daedalus
program is an honors scholarship program. It&amp;#39;s similar to the well
known CUNY Macaulay program but it&amp;#39;s specific to Hunter and specific to
CS. Our kids get scholarships, laptops, special classes (with me),
activities and events and more. Our first cohort had 12. This past
year we had 23 but a funny thing happened right after we started. Hunter&amp;#39;s
Macaulay CS students heard about what was going on and wanted in. The
end result was that last years cohort had a total of 27 students
as we invited the incoming Hunter Macaulay CS students into the
fold. This year, we&amp;#39;re up to about 50 total and it looks to be a very
strong group. To be honest I&amp;#39;m a little
scared of growing this quickly. The kids will be great but it will be
a challenge building the community across multiple classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m really pleased with the first two cohorts performance both in
class and out. They&amp;#39;re progressing well through the academic program
and are ahead of schedule in terms of internships and outside
activities but I&amp;#39;m even happier that they&amp;#39;ve been working to level up
Hunter CS as a whole. They started a once a week Dojo last year where
all Hunter CS students could hang out and work on tech projects and
have a speaker series on tap for this coming year. For my part, I&amp;#39;ve
got a couple of new ideas up my sleeve but I&amp;#39;m going to keep them
under wraps for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Three years ago Hunter wasn&amp;#39;t so much on the map for CS inclined high
school students and while there&amp;#39;s much work to be done, many of our
incoming cohort members chose us over other programs that have
traditionally been considered CS strongholds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the same time, our efforts to connect Hunter CS to the NY Tech community have begun to
raise our profile on the other end of the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s still a long rode ahead but I thought I&amp;#39;d give myself a day to
look back on how far we&amp;#39;ve come in a short time. Having a great public college option for CS
education is critical for NYC. This was one of the things I left Stuy to
accomplish and we&amp;#39;re well on our way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PD for people who know CS</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/pd-for-cs/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I saw a couple of tweets from Sarah Judd this morning:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-conversation=&#34;none&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;A lot of CS Ed PD assumes you are new to CS. I really want CS Ed PD for people like us that came from a CS background and want to understand the pedagogy for CS in particular better. Do you know of some?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Sarah Judd (@SarahEJudd) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SarahEJudd/status/1011785286693552139?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;June 27, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-conversation=&#34;none&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Yes! I love SIGCSE and CSTA. I just feel like... Math teachers don&amp;#39;t get PD that starts with &amp;quot;and this is how you add and subtract!&amp;quot; and I&amp;#39;d love more CS PD that assumes the content is there, and can focus on the pedagogy.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Sarah Judd (@SarahEJudd) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SarahEJudd/status/1011966102795059200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;June 27, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It wasn&amp;#39;t the first time I&amp;#39;ve heard this refrain. Last year I attended
my first CSTA conference. I had numerous conversations with CS
teachers on the fact that everything was on an intro level in terms of
both content and teaching. Further conversations with local teachers
with stronger CS backgrounds led me to run a professional development
session at Hunter this past election day for more experienced CS
teachers at schools that offered more than the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While it&amp;#39;s not surprising that most of the PD opportunities for CS teachers are
rather rudimentary given that nationally most programs are new and
most teachers are new to the subject but there are a few deeper
reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To start, there are big players in the CS Ed movement that are pushing
curricula and specific programs and that leads to scripted PD for
their products and not depth of knowledge nor deep pedagogical content
knowledge let alone basic pedagogy. Add to this the fact that many of
the &amp;#34;thought leaders&amp;#34; in the space don&amp;#39;t have experience teaching CS
at the K12 level and in many cases don&amp;#39;t have a background either in
teaching nor tech and you can see where the problem comes from. On top
of this we have the erosion of respect for teaching as a profession
where reformers are trying to take the teacher out of teaching and are
trying to reduce pedagogy to following scripts. This problem goes well
beyond CS Ed but as the new kid on the block it probably hits us
hardest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any case, preparing beginners is both necessary and appropriate for
the time being but we can and must do a better job than what&amp;#39;s
currently &amp;#34;state of the art.&amp;#34; At the same time we have to do something
with the CS teachers who indeed do have strong content knowledge but
don&amp;#39;t feel comfortable with imparting that knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, what should we do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For new teachers the solution will ultimately have to come
from pre-service programs but what we end up getting is going to
largely be dictated on what&amp;#39;s required by individual states. If states
merely require passing an exam like the Praxis CS exam which, from
what I can gather isn&amp;#39;t a horrible content exam then we&amp;#39;re going to
see CS teachers bumble through their early to mid careers while trying
to figure out how to teach CS much like I did way back when. If they
end up endorsing pre-service programs that are focused on specific
curricula - APCS-A for teachers, APCS-P for teachers, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/math-for-math-teachers/&#34;&gt;Math for Math
teachers&lt;/a&gt; if you will but for CS, we&amp;#39;re also not going to get strong
well prepared pedagogues. On the other hand if you can design a
program that has a strong pedagogical component to go along with the
content, you have a chance. Even with a well designed program
implementation will still be a challenge. Who will teach it? Education
professors who don&amp;#39;t have CS backgrounds? CS professors with little
pedagogical training? Neither of those groups necessarily have any
real experience as actual K12 teachers. If you can find honest to
goodness experienced, strong K12 CS teachers to teach your pedagogy
courses that&amp;#39;s a big win but that&amp;#39;s going to be hard in most cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think we designed a great program at Hunter and have a practical and
strong implementation plan. If you&amp;#39;re going to be
at CSTA2018 you can hear all about it and why we designed it as we did
in the talk I&amp;#39;m giving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For the more experienced I don&amp;#39;t have a universal answer but I can say
what I&amp;#39;m planning. Teachers in NY have to complete 100 CTLE hours
every five years. For beginners, there are plenty of options, at least
content wise. For teachers who know CS, not so much. I was at a meetup
talking to a few friends a couple of weeks ago and one mentioned that
they get most of their hours in Math for America CS
workshops. Unfortunately more than a few of my CS teacher friends who
are in MFA tell me that the CS content in these workshops, while they
do satisfy the hours, are somewhat lacking on the CS / CS pedagogy
side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m planning - we (Hunter) will host a once a month
dinner/session for CS teachers who are a little farther along CS
wise. I haven&amp;#39;t worked out all the details yet but I&amp;#39;ve got a few tech
companies that are already interested in sponsoring and helping out
should we need anything and we&amp;#39;ll probably set most of our agenda for
the year at the first session where I&amp;#39;ll make my best guess at a
useful agenda. This is something I&amp;#39;m pretty excited about. It should
help create a network of more experienced CS teachers which will both
help bolster that segment of the community and provide a long term
resource to newcomers and it should be a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In some ways, this is why I ended up joining Hunter. Regardless of
what the city and state do, we&amp;#39;re going to prepare the teachers and if
you have a well prepared teacher, you&amp;#39;ve got a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Emacs Episode 49 mu4e-conversation</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-49-mu4e-conversation/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-49-mu4e-conversation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been using Emacs for email for a couple of years now. Not for
everything, for now my personal email is still Gmail but work is sent
and read through Emacs. I&amp;#39;m currently using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html&#34;&gt;mu4e&lt;/a&gt; and while it has a
few quirks and limitations, I like it very much. You can take a look
on how I configure and use it &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-39-mu4e/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The other day I saw &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/8qryri/mu4econversation_single_buffer_fullthread_display/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; thread on Emacs about a new package -
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/ambrevar/mu4e-conversation&#34;&gt;mu4e-conversation&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s a package that deals with email threads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s pretty cool. You can invoke it whenever you&amp;#39;re in the headers
view you can just run &lt;code&gt;M-x mu4e-conversation&lt;/code&gt; and it combines all the
email messages in the current thread into a single buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s pretty nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can navigate between messages in the thread with &lt;code&gt;C-c C-n&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;C-c C-p&lt;/code&gt; and use most if not all of the usual mu4e goodness but on
top of that you can also toggle what the author calls tree mode by
hitting &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt;. Tree mode turns the thread into an org-mode tree - also
extremely cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On top of this, you can also make mu4e your default viewing mode by
setting a single variable with &lt;code&gt;(setq mu4e-view-func &amp;#39;mu4e-conversation)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Although it&amp;#39;s very cool, I&amp;#39;m not sure if mu4e-conversation will find
its way into my workflow or not and probably won&amp;#39;t know for a
while. This is mostly due to the fact that it&amp;#39;s summer so work email
slows down and I won&amp;#39;t have too many long threads to play with this
on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ll report back once I give it a fair shake but in the meantime if
anyone out there has had the time to play with it, let us know what
you think.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How I Grokked OOP</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/how-i-grokked-oop/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 14 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Time to get back to CS and CS Ed related blogging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Last week, in Garth Flint&amp;#39;s post about his &lt;a href=&#34;https://gflint.wordpress.com/2018/06/01/747/&#34;&gt;summer plans&lt;/a&gt;, Garth
mentioned wanting to get his head around Object Oriented Programming
and possibly taking a course to help him get there. I thought I&amp;#39;d talk
a little about how I got my head around OOP here and some of the
difficulties I faced then and what people might face now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Nowadays, kids are faced with OOP pretty early on. If they take APCS-A
they&amp;#39;re using Java which is Object Oriented. Same if they start
at a college using Java. If they start with C++ or Python they may or
may not see objects early on. In any event, the nature of that first
course doesn&amp;#39;t really lend itself to really grokking OOP. Even if a
student takes a class prior to APCS-A or it&amp;#39;s college equivalent,
they&amp;#39;re pretty y raw. Small programs with just a few constructs don&amp;#39;t
really show the uses of OOP. Both inheritance and interfaces can feel
forced in a first year course and when the examples are artificial and
wonky and their are easier ways to accomplish the same task, it&amp;#39;s hard
for a student to really buy into the paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, in all fairness, I&amp;#39;m not a big fan of Object Oriented Programming
and it&amp;#39;s usually not the first tool I go to. That said, it&amp;#39;s a useful
tool and it has it&amp;#39;s place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I cut my teeth in the 1980s. I went to the Courant Institute at
NYU. The core language back then was Pascal which had a number of
limitations including only supporting single file programs. Somewhere
along the line I taught myself C which most professors were happy to
accept assignments in. I never heard of OOP in my formal
schooling. Some time near or soon after I graduated I had heard of
this C++ thing but hadn&amp;#39;t used it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After working my way through school I spent some time as a developer
at Goldman Sachs. I was the only guy on my team doing Windows 2.1
development. Windows 2.1 was built on top of DOS. It&amp;#39;s big improvement
over Windows 1.0 was that it supported overlapping windows. Pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8f/Windows_2.1.png&#34; alt=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8f/Windows_2.1.png&#34; title=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8f/Windows_2.1.png&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I learned to program Windows like everyone else:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.charlespetzold.com/oop/pw1.png&#34; alt=&#34;http://www.charlespetzold.com/oop/pw1.png&#34; title=&#34;http://www.charlespetzold.com/oop/pw1.png&#34; width=&#34;200px&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It was all done in C. The big project I was on was for Global
Equities. Specifically, supporting trading of Japanese Warrants. I had
to write a trading system and in doing that implement among other
things a mini spreadsheet in C from bare metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This was probably going to be the most complex thing I designed and
built from scratch to date. I had a bunch of cells that were
associated with either rows or columns or both and all sorts of
complex interactions. I needed a way to manage complexity and even
though I didn&amp;#39;t use the term at the time, manage state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
C doesn&amp;#39;t have a lot of fancy in language constructs to help and I was
somewhat on an island - I taught myself C and there weren&amp;#39;t any
experienced C / Windows programmers in my group or on my floor so I
had to figure things out on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s what I came up with, or rather something like what I came up
with – it was close to 30 years ago and I don&amp;#39;t even remember 100% of
what it was supposed to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I decided to create a single file for each concept -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cell.c / cell.h for cells&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;row.c / row.h for rows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sheet.c / sheet.h for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each, I would do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-c&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34; data-lang=&#34;c&#34;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-c&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34; data-lang=&#34;c&#34;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The idea is that everything about a sheet is in &lt;code&gt;sheet.c&lt;/code&gt; and only a
few functions are made available to the rest of the program via the
header file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Shortly after I designed the program, I started to delve into OOP at
the encouragement of some colleagues. I read Meyer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1392538685l/3328934.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1392538685l/3328934.jpg&#34; title=&#34;https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1392538685l/3328934.jpg&#34; width=&#34;200px&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and the first edition of Booch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/bigcovers/0/8/0/5/0805353402.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;https://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/bigcovers/0/8/0/5/0805353402.jpg&#34; title=&#34;https://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/bigcovers/0/8/0/5/0805353402.jpg&#34; width=&#34;200px&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I realized that in a way I was implementing singleton objects in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file declared the object. The functions I exposed via the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;header files were public, the other functions private and the &amp;#34;global&amp;#34;
variables that were local to the file, private class variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There was no inheritance but it did help me encapsulate functionality
and state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It turns out I saw something like this when I briefly looked at Ada. I
think it was called Object Typed Programming - objects with only a
single instance and no inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The books gave me the official names for things but the project I was
developing gave me the context to where it all made sense. I had a
problem to solve that didn&amp;#39;t lend itself to a low level imperative
language but you work with the tools you have and this is what I came
up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunately, it&amp;#39;s harder for beginners as projects are smaller and
while there are good small example of OOP there&amp;#39;s also so much going
on in a course like APCS-A. It gets more convoluted when you&amp;#39;re using
Python or C++ as you might be shown Objects in a C++ class while
professor is really teaching C with Objects rather than doing things
the C++ way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One thing that helps is using a language or tool where objects make
sense. NetLogo - used in Stuy&amp;#39;s intro course is a nice one. Turtles
and patches - the inhabitants of the NetLogo can be viewed as
objects. I&amp;#39;d draw heavily on NetLogo analogies when teaching APCS at
Stuy. There are also tools like BlueJ which is tied closely to objects
and is probably terrific at giving structure to help objects make
sense but I don&amp;#39;t like those types of tools for other reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the end of the day, it is just a tool and to be honest, I&amp;#39;m not
really a big fan of OOP. I&amp;#39;ll use it but it&amp;#39;s not my go to paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ll leave you with this video which talks about why:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Giving control of NYC&#39;s specialized schools to a political appointee</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/shsat-part2/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/shsat-part2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday I shared my thoughts on Bill de Blasio&amp;#39;s plans to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; the
selection criteria for New York City&amp;#39;s specialized high schools. If
you haven&amp;#39;t read the post, you can find it &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/shsat/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was going to get back to CS and CS Ed related blogging today but
there&amp;#39;s more to the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In spite of what BdB stated, it&amp;#39;s not enough for him to switch to another
measure - the middle school state exam along with some modifiers. This
is about ending the exam altogether and not replacing it with anything
better. Here&amp;#39;s a link to information on the proposed legislation for
&lt;a href=&#34;https://legiscan.com/NY/bill/A10427/2017&#34;&gt;New York Assembly Bill 10427&lt;/a&gt; including links to the actual text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s a lot of beurobabble but the end game is to basically allow
the chancellor (not sure if this means city or state) to do whatever
they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here are some of the key points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seats would ultimately go to the top 5 to 7 percent of each middle school&amp;#39;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These students would have to also be classified in the top 25% city wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top is defined by a composite score of multiple measures as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;determined by the chancellor which means anything goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remaining seats will be filled by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;lottery of all students with a 3.7 GPA or greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not clear how the students would be allocated to each of the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;specialized schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, what does this all mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Multiple measures could mean the state test + average. It could mean
average + recommendation. It could be shoe size + favorite color. The
chancellor also decides how to weight these multiple measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This means that the politicians can do whatever they want to paint any
picture they want regardless of how their ideological and political
games hurt kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Any teacher, in fact, any rational adult  will tell you that middle
schools are not interchangeable. The top students at one middle school
are typically not at the same level as top students at another
one. I&amp;#39;m sure you can cluster middle schools in terms of the students
they graduate, what the students know and can do and the clusters will
likely fall on economic lines. This is the problem that BdB should be
addressing not how to rig the specialized school admissions stats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even if this is done right, you&amp;#39;re assuming an even distribution of
top gifted students across all the middle schools. If one school has
higher concentration of gifted students, they&amp;#39;re out of luck. The end
result is that if you attend an SP or other gifted program for eighth
grade you&amp;#39;ll likely be locked out of the specialized schools. What if
a particular middle school is attractive to all of our top math team
talent? Only a couple will get in to the specialized schools under the
new system since each school is allocated a fixed number of slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I guess this does make sense if you don&amp;#39;t believe in gifted students
or gifted education but then why not just get rid of the specialized
schools to begin with rather than playing these games. This &amp;#34;solution&amp;#34;
will result in parents having to decide - do I send my kids to the
gifted middle school program and hurt their chances to get into a
specialized high school or do I try to find the lowest performing
school I can find and have my kid stand out. This is pretty messed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the end of the day, though, you have to remember that any change to
the process can help one group and hurt another. Stuy, for example has
46% of it&amp;#39;s students on free or reduced lunch and is about 70%
Asian. If in the new system you&amp;#39;re increasing the percent population
of an under represented group, you&amp;#39;re likely reducing the percentage
of Asian students. So, you&amp;#39;re creating opportunities for a number of as of yet
undetermined students (who might not be properly prepared for the
experience) at the expense of economically disadvantaged Asian
students who have proven to be prepared for the experience. Wouldn&amp;#39;t
a better solution be to fix the opportunities presented at the middle
schools rather than rig the system of high school acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Going further, a response on another blog noted that BdB probably
refused to do anything with the admissions criteria of the non big
three because they all had numbers that he would consider more
diverse. The commenter provided the Black / Latino percentages, I added the
free and reduced lunch numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border-spacing=&#34;10px&#34; frame=&#34;border&#34;&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;School&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Percent Black / Latino&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Free / Reduced Lunch&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Brooklyn Latin&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;28%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;61%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;HSMSE&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;26%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;46%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;HSAS&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;17%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;25%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Queens Sci&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;64%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All the more reason to run some tests or analysis there. Of course, if
you look further you&amp;#39;ll note that HSAS only has 25% of its students on
free or reduced lunch so is it really doing better than Stuy or Sci
with ~45% low income students  each  or Brooklyn Tech which supports
62% or are we to say that there&amp;#39;s low income and then there&amp;#39;s the
right low income?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Certainly the education system needs work but the proposed legislation
is not a solution. It&amp;#39;s taking a flawed but objective measure and
replacing it with essentially chancellor&amp;#39;s discretion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the legislation passes, by the year 2022 we will have admissions to
what used to be some of the nations finest high schools determined by
a political appointee rather than an objective test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s a shame. It was very important to my wife and me to have our kids
go to public schools and I was very happy to have been able to
navigate the system with them from first grade through high school
graduation with only a few bumps along the way. With this nonsense
from the political left and the privatization push from the political
right (or actually both sides) pretty soon there will be nothing left.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Changing Admissions to the NYC Specialized High Schools</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/shsat/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 03 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>
&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday, Bill de Blasio, the current Mayor of New York City outlined
how he would &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; our specialized schools. The schools he was
referring to were the &amp;#34;big three&amp;#34; of Stuyvesant, Bronx Science, and
Brooklyn Tech and then five additional schools - The High School  for
Math Science and Engineering at CCNY, The High School for American
Studies at Lehman, Brooklyn Latin, The Queens Arts and Science High
School at
York College, and Staten Island Tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All use a single SAT style test, the SHSAT, for admission. The Big Three are
locked into that system unless there are changes made by the state
legislature. The Mayor can make changes to the admissions criteria of
the other five on his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The problem, as stated by Chalkbeat writers Alex Zimmerman and  Monica
Disare is that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city’s specialized high schools — considered some of the crown
jewels of New York City’s education system — accept students based on
a single test score. Over the last decade, they have come under fire
for offering admissions to few students of color: While two-thirds of
city students are black or Hispanic, only about 10 percent of
admissions offers to those schools go to black or Hispanic students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I normally don&amp;#39;t write about things like this but given my history at
and with Stuyvesant I thought I should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before getting started, my biases - I believe in public schools, not
charters, I also believe that a system should have gifted programs and
magnet schools and also a mix of large comprehensive schools and
smaller niche ones. Additionally, while I do believe in gifted
programs I&amp;#39;m not sure at what point it makes sense to start offering
them. When we were looking at elementary schools for our own kids we
opted for a neighborhood public school rather than applying to the
district gifted program as we felt it offered a better overall
education. On the other hand, had our kids not made Stuyvesant, I&amp;#39;m
not sure what we would have done. Part of that was due to the fact
that the Bloomberg administration destroyed just about all the large
comprehensive schools so, other than that large test schools and
LaGuardia, good luck finding a school that was strong in the
humanities, sciences and offered a robust music program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
The overall picture
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For reference, here are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theschoolboards.com/showthread.php/4324-Specialized-High-School-SHSAT-Cutoff-Scores-for-2018&#34;&gt;unofficial cutoff scores&lt;/a&gt; for the specialized
schools from 2018 along with the NY State data on free and reduced
lunch for 2017. Note that there&amp;#39;s overlap between the schools. I
separated out SI Tech since geography probably affects it&amp;#39;s numbers
more than the other schools and I separated the big three from the
remaining four because I think the three are all substantially larger. The
free and reduced lunch percent is important because I believe an
entire school qualifies for Title I funding if the number&amp;#39;s
over 40 so while these schools are not populated entirely by low
income students, all but HSAS has a substantial number and there&amp;#39;s a
chance, some say a good one that at best BdB&amp;#39;s plans will merely
shuffle which low income kids get in rather than actually solving the
root problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
The plan
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-3&#34;&gt;
Part 1 - test prep
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s idea here is that test prep is rampant for SHSAT and that the
test can be gamed. This may or may not be true but if it is then it&amp;#39;s
safe to assume that a lot of low income kids are doing test
prep either by prioritizing test prep programs in family budgets,
working off of an SHSAT test prep book or by attending a middle school
that has some form of prep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There has long been a program on the books called &amp;#34;The Discovery
Program&amp;#34; which has a free city run test prep component and also a
summer component. The summer component is for low income students who
score within &amp;#34;a few points&amp;#34; of the school in question&amp;#39;s cutoff
score. At the end of the summer, I believe the students retest and in
general make the school in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This program is a good thing and should be reinstated&lt;/strong&gt; but I don&amp;#39;t
know if it will result in the changes that BdB is looking for. More
likely Stuy will get its discovery kids from Science and Science from
Tech. As there are already many low income students at all of the
schools there&amp;#39;s no indication that this would increase the number of
under represented groups which is BdB&amp;#39;s goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s also worth noting that there&amp;#39;s a sizable chunk of Brooklyn Tech
students that don&amp;#39;t perform particularly well on regents exams.
Everyone knows I&amp;#39;m not a fan of standardized tests and I don&amp;#39;t
believe that students that score a &amp;#34;few points&amp;#34; lower on the SHSAT are
any less qualified to be in a specialized school but at the lowest
performing end of these schools, one has to ask how specialized is it
really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-4&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-4&#34;&gt;
Part 2 - use state test scores instead of the SHSAT
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-4&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This &lt;strong&gt;could be&lt;/strong&gt; a &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; good thing with one major caveat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Twenty one middle schools produce over half the students that
ultimately are accepted to the specialized schools. For the rest,
there are a few reasons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many students don&amp;#39;t take the SHSAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been stories of schools steering kids away from the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;specialized schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no culture in those schools of striving for specialized&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;school acceptance or attendance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The academic programs at those schools don&amp;#39;t prepare students for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the SHSAT exam for reasons that we&amp;#39;re not going to delve into here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All students already take the NY State middle school Math and English
exams. Yes, it would further raise the stakes for those exams but it
would ensure that the specialized schools are on the map for everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The big question here is &amp;#34;do the current state exams cover enough
material in enough depth to select and differentiate for gifted
programs.&amp;#34; I don&amp;#39;t know the answer to this question. If they don&amp;#39;t
then using state test scores will be a disaster. If they do, then they
could be a suitable alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-5&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-5&#34;&gt;
Part 3 - admissions from every middle school
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-5&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is the third part of BdB&amp;#39;s proposal - guarantee admissions to the
top 10% of students at every middle school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This could be a real disaster either for the students or for the
schools. There&amp;#39;s no question that students coming out of different
middle schools are at different levels of preparedness for the
specialized schools. Arguably the most obvious difference is that some
middle schools offer algebra and others don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For better or worse, the specialized school&amp;#39;s curricula, classes, and
overall programs have evolved hand in hand with the exam. If you all
of a sudden end up placing a large number of students with a
different and arguable weaker academic profile into these schools one
of two things will happen. Either the students will struggle immensely
or the school will have to lower its standards. There&amp;#39;s no two ways
about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you set standards for academic preparedness for the specialized
schools either by making a hard cutoff on an exam score be it state or
SHSAT and then spread those acceptances across all the schools maybe
it could work. If not, you&amp;#39;re setting up students with high grades at
schools with weak programs up for failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another problem is what to do with non-public school students -
private schools, charters which take public money but act as private
schools, parochial, and home school students. Where do they fall in to
this equation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-6&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-6&#34;&gt;
Is one measure bad?
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-6&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So there you have my thoughts on BdB&amp;#39;s specific proposals but I also
want to address his contention that a single measure is bad and makes
the comparison to colleges where they by and large use multiple
measures. This is a ridiculous comparison. Yes, colleges look at
multiple measures but after watching decades of Stuy students go off
to college, it&amp;#39;s clear to me that the process is by no means fair or
consistent. Elite schools can easily game their acceptances and
they still can have 100% of their applicants with off the charts SAT
scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A single test might not be ideal but it can only be gamed by test prep
and test prep can be as cheap as buying a test prep book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As to other measures that come up from time to time - interviews,
portfolios, essays - who does that help? The low income kid or the
well to do one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you&amp;#39;re going to add another measure for admission it has to be
something that can&amp;#39;t be gamed or politically influenced,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-7&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-7&#34;&gt;
Alternatives
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-7&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Should the city address the fact that there are groups that are under
represented at the specialized schools? Certainly, or rather, the city
should address deficiencies in opportunities that are like the causes
of this under representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Should the city be doing things differently? Also yes. Here are some
thoughts on what the city can and should be doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-8&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-8&#34;&gt;
Do the experiments in the non-big three.
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-8&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are five specialized schools that aren&amp;#39;t covered by state
legislation. Why not run your experiments there. You&amp;#39;ve got  the big
three as a control group and what&amp;#39;s more if you look at the
&amp;#34;acceptance score windows&amp;#34; in the table above, you&amp;#39;ll see that there&amp;#39;s
enough overlap that you can probably get some real data out of these
experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why not change the admissions criteria for one or two of them and see
how it goes before jumping in whole hog. Figure out if anything works first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-9&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-9&#34;&gt;
Check existing data
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-9&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We&amp;#39;ve got SHSAT results and State Test score results along with
student grades for years. Why not study correlations between
them. Rather than making a specious claim about middle school grades
in NYC Public Schools vs state tests vs the SHSAT, run the
numbers. Take a look at student high school performance based on these
predictions. This shouldn&amp;#39;t be guess work and city should have the
data to do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-10&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-10&#34;&gt;
Fix the middle schools
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-10&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This one is more pie in the sky because no politician really wants to
take this one but you&amp;#39;ve got to look at what&amp;#39;s going on in the middle
schools and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I tweeted this the other day:&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;would love to see this experiment - take the entire staff / faculty / admin of one of the 20 or so middle schools that are the primary feeders to the spec schls and swap them with another middle school and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Mike Zamansky (@zamansky) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/zamansky/status/1003074760786501632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;June 3, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The truth is that if you did this, the high performing school would
probably continue to be high performing and the low performing one
would still struggle. There&amp;#39;s only so much a teacher can do. A school
with a disadvantaged population needs the resources to succeed - lower
class sizes for a start. Add wraparound services, extensive after
school and weekend opportunities - make the schools a part of the
community and maybe we can get somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another question relating to our schools in general is to look at
attrition rates to private schools - how many students in our under
represented groups are being siphoned off to private schools on
scholarship. I don&amp;#39;t have any data for this. It could be an
insignificant amount or it could go a long way in explaining the
downturn in the numbers over the decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-11&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-11&#34;&gt;
So where are we
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-11&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are a lot of changes I&amp;#39;d love to see in our public schools and I
do believe BdB&amp;#39;s heart is in the right place. I&amp;#39;m concerned that some
of the solutions that he and other politicians come up with will hurt
the current low income students at the specialized schools and
unintentionally advantage the well to do while not helping those that
at least BdB may honestly want to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He should enact Discovery and research the State Tests but proceed
with caution. The test schools have always been and continue to be a
gateway for poor and immigrant students and any changes that are
proposed should be weighed carefully and &lt;strong&gt;tested&lt;/strong&gt; before taking steps
that could real harm when good is intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>The Tech or the Teacher</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/tech-or-teacher/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 31 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/tech-or-teacher/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Every morning one of the first things I do is quickly glance at my
emails and other notifications. I really should wait until I&amp;#39;m more
awake but old habits die hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As some of you know over the past couple of years I&amp;#39;ve been making a
series of &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs&#34;&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; and related post on using my editor of choice,
Emacs. I&amp;#39;ve done 48 videos, have over 2500 subscribers on
YouTube and people seem to find some value from the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This morning one of my emails was a new comment on one of my videos:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for not describing a single key combination and how that fits
into basic usage of org mode.  I was going to subscribe but if all
your videos are going to be about showing off how fast you are at
typing emacs commands on your annoyingly noisy keyborad, then no
thanks!﻿&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My first reaction was &amp;#34;you know, you could have said something like
&amp;#39;if you slow down an actually say the keys it would be much easier to
follow and would be more valuable&amp;#39; and it would be much better received&amp;#34; but
then I started to think about instructional videos in general. I
started to make these videos for my students. I thought they might be
helpful and then found that the Emacs community by and large liked
them. They&amp;#39;re not teaching anything deep or complicated just how I use
a programmable editor. Even so, I was reminded by this comment about
the limitations of videos and ed tech in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Videos provide some nice features - you can watch them at any time,
you can pause and replay, and in some cases you can watch at super
speeds. What you can&amp;#39;t do is slow the video down and most importantly
you can&amp;#39;t ask questions or interact with the instructor. You can leave
comments if the video is on a platform like YouTube but that&amp;#39;s pretty
limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, if this was a class, we would have been able to
interact and I as the instructor would have had a much better chance
to make sure this &amp;#34;student&amp;#34; was up to speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, this wasn&amp;#39;t a class. I don&amp;#39;t have the time to teach tools
like Emacs in class and since it is a mechanical skill, it can be
offloaded to a video. The video has the ancillary benefit of living on
and being discoverable and viewable by the public at large. This is a
good thing. Videos are tech and tech scales. Unfortunately, good
education doesn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Videos are tech and tech is the rage. Lots of people are working hard
to get more tech in front of our kids - usually at the expense of
having a great teacher. This is something we don&amp;#39;t need. Technology is
nice but I&amp;#39;d rather have my kids in a small class with a knowledgable
teacher and a piece of chalk than all the tech in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a computer science guy and a computer science teacher I think it&amp;#39;s
good to remind myself that tech is cool but a good teacher is way cooler.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teaching recursion early? Make sure to use a good tool.</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/recursion-early/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/recursion-early/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I replied this tweet yesterday and thought I&amp;#39;d expound a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;We started kids using scheme on 10th grade at stuy so did recursion early. Not everyone got all of it but it think it made things much easier for those that you more CS later.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Mike Zamansky (@zamansky) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/zamansky/status/1001508028439519233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;May 29, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We introduced recursion very early in our intro course at Stuy and I
think it worked well. In that course we started by using Racket (nee
Scheme) as the first programming unit. Originally we
started the kids out first using NetLogo or StarLogo and followed with
Scheme but after a few years we switched the order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I wouldn&amp;#39;t always recommend Scheme for a first course and in fact
frequently don&amp;#39;t but given how the Stuy course was introduced and
developed it made sense and worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Was it worth doing things this way? I think so. Prior to that intro
course becoming a requirement I got to see students coming in from
different pathways to APCS. Some came in raw with zero formal
experience, some self taught, some through that intro course and some
having taken another more traditional intro programming course or
experience. The kids who started on Scheme had no more difficulty
mastering loops and iteration but had an easier time getting to the
more advanced recursive techniques. This wasn&amp;#39;t a surprise - it wasn&amp;#39;t
their first rodeo. This also jived with reports I read at the time
that felt that when students did recursion first, iteration was just
as easy but when they did iteration first, recursion was harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can of course make a strong case that recursion isn&amp;#39;t necessary
for a kid that isn&amp;#39;t going to study more CS. I&amp;#39;ll merely argue that
what we did at Stuy worked with that population and I wouldn&amp;#39;t change
it. At the same time, I&amp;#39;ve helped a number of teachers design classes and programs
where we agreed that recursion first was not the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any event, it wasn&amp;#39;t that I specifically wanted to do recursion
early but rather, there were a number of things I wanted to do with
the class for which Scheme made sense and recursion was just one of
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some reasons to like (or for some, to dislike) Scheme early:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s functional – everything is a function. While this is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;technically not true, we can fudge it a bit at this level. You put
things in parens so instead of add(a,b) you write (add a b) or
really (+ a b). You can also do (+ a b c). Things that would be
statements are also functions: (if Booelean TruePart FalsePart) is the &lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt;
statement. For example &lt;code&gt;(if (&amp;gt;= a b) a b)&lt;/code&gt; returns the larger of a
and b.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it&amp;#39;s functional it avoids the issue kids have with &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; being&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for assignment rather than comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has great support for list processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recursion is much more natural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a super simple language with simple rules and a simple, small  syntax&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Scheme isn&amp;#39;t perfect and some people dislike the above
reasons. It&amp;#39;s also easy to come up with a number of other good reasons
not to use a language like Scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the recursion front, it makes things much easier. There are no
loops so recursion develops as a natural form for repetition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-scheme&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-scheme&#34; data-lang=&#34;scheme&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-scheme&#34; data-lang=&#34;scheme&#34;&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;define &lt;/span&gt;f (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;lambda &lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;)
(* x  (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; (- x &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;)))))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This defines a function that takes one parameter and returns
&lt;code&gt;x*(x-1)*(x-2)...&lt;/code&gt;. It repeats, but never ends. This leads to adding
a base case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-scheme&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-scheme&#34; data-lang=&#34;scheme&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-scheme&#34; data-lang=&#34;scheme&#34;&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;define &lt;/span&gt;f (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;lambda &lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;)
(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;if &lt;/span&gt;(&amp;lt; x &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
(* x (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; (- x &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;))))))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Which is your basic factorial function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since this use of recursion for repetition  develops naturally as we
introduce language concepts it&amp;#39;s easier for kids to get their heads
around it as opposed to when they&amp;#39;ve seen loops already and have an
&amp;#34;easier&amp;#34; alternative. You can make the case that you could introduce
recursion this way in a language with loops like Python but once loops
are available and particularly when loops are idiomatic, students will
find them and getting them to think recursively will be more
difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Scheme and most other functional programming languages also have
strong support for lists and list recursion. This means you don&amp;#39;t have
to limit yourself to mathy problems. Think about a todo list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to the market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy a gallon of milk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they have eggs, get a dozen (heh heh)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go home&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Processing a todo list is really a recursive problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the list is empty you&amp;#39;re done&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the first item off  the list&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recurse&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you start working with lists, you can play with all sorts of
recursive examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the end of the Scheme unit the big project is creating a sentence
generator. The kids don&amp;#39;t know it but they&amp;#39;re learning about grammars
and in fact are writing a recursive descent parser - they just think
they&amp;#39;re writing a program that creates silly sentences. It&amp;#39;s a really
nice project that uses recursion in a way that&amp;#39;s different and I&amp;#39;d
argue more fun and interesting than the usual approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I chose Scheme for a variety of reasons. I also chose NetLogo for
specific reasons. Unlike Scheme (or most other popular learning
languages), NetLogo is really all about agent based parallel
processing. There are concepts that we can explore easily and in depth
with NetLogo that would be tremendously difficult in any other
language and at the same time, there are things that are easy to
explore in other languages that Netlogo doesn&amp;#39;t lend itself to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, in the end, this post really isn&amp;#39;t about when to teach
recursion. It&amp;#39;s more about how languages lend themselves to solving
different problems and teaching different concepts in different
ways. If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a
nail. Fortunately, we can do better.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is Cs for All Worth Doing</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/is-cs4all-worth-doing/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/is-cs4all-worth-doing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Last time I mentioned the pushback on CS for All. While many people
are all in for CS for All, resistance is coming from many
areas. There&amp;#39;s resistance from teachers of other subject areas, people
who think it&amp;#39;s merely job training for the tech industry (which it can be if done poorly),
people who feel it will be implemented at the expense of other
important subjects already on the chopping block like music and art,
and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I started the intro course at Stuy I tried to design something
that would be of value to all Stuy students and also inspire some to
continue on to more advanced CS classes. The class has been a
requirement for well over a decade at this point. I know that not
everyone loved the course but as they say, the proof is in the
pudding. It clearly got more people into the pool as gender numbers
for our more advanced CS courses got and remained much better since
the intro class became a requirement. I can&amp;#39;t tell you how many people
now in tech have told me that they never considered CS and only got
into it from our intro course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, we had CS for All at Stuy before there was a CS for All and if
exposing more kids to CS was the only benefit it would have been worth
it but there&amp;#39;s more. In addition to getting more people and more
underrepresented people into tech, I&amp;#39;ve had scores of kids in a huge
range of fields come back to exclaim the value of having been forced
to take our intro course. These kids became authors, lawyers,
entrepreneurs, (non CS) teachers, journalists, venture capitalists,
Wall Street people, (non CS) professors and researchers, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The benefit of being in the latter stages of a career is that you can
look back at years of results and see the good and the bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s no doubt in my mind that the battle to get a good CS course to
every Stuy student was one worth fighting and winning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Should CS for All be implemented at the college level?</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/csforall-in-college/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 25 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/csforall-in-college/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s been a lively discussion on pushback to CS for All at the K12
level over on Facebook. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/guzdial&#34;&gt;Mark Guzdial&lt;/a&gt; started a sub thread asking if CS
for All should first be implemented at the undergrad level rather than K12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s an interesting question and as good as anything to get me out of
my month long non-blogging rut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Mark was right when he said that if Colleges implement CS for All, K12 will
likely do so to follow - just look at AP. Colleges have been saying
that students should take more AP classes (while giving less credit)
and we all know where that&amp;#39;s led.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, can colleges really do CS for All, what does it
mean and what would it look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Much like there is no single K12 - it&amp;#39;s 50 states and who knows how
many independent school districts, there won&amp;#39;t be a single CS for All
at the college level but let&amp;#39;s think about how things could play out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many colleges have distribution requirements. Students must take one
course from bucket A, two from bucket B etc. Many schools that I&amp;#39;ve
looked at already  count CS courses in one of their distribution
buckets. This doesn&amp;#39;t mean every student will take CS but in theory
means they can. Colleges could in theory create a required CS bucket
or even a required CS course but I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s as easy as
that. It might be at a private institution but while I don&amp;#39;t know all
the ins and outs of Hunter&amp;#39;s governance rules I do know that adding a
universal student requirement is a HUGE undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So my take is that while it might be easy for a private college
to add a CS requirement I&amp;#39;m guessing other public institutions are
more similar to Hunter and it&amp;#39;s not going to be an easy task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Regardless, let&amp;#39;s say we have a required class on the books. Will we
have the capacity to teach it? It seems that schools are struggling to deal
with their existing CS majors and running sufficient electives and
courses for them. Just a month or so ago there was an article about a
college ending its CS minor due to lack of resources. It doesn&amp;#39;t sound
like a radically different problem then that faced in K12. Maybe it&amp;#39;s
harder given that at least in NY, there is &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/room-for-csforall&#34;&gt;room for a required CS
course&lt;/a&gt; if you can find the teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even so, assuming we have the capacity to enroll every undergrad in a
CS course what would that be? I think most people would be in
agreement that it shouldn&amp;#39;t be CS 101. Maybe existing pre-major
courses but even there I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s always the best
path. There could be a great pre-major course to give students the
basics and lead some into the major but what about a CS course for
students in majors that need some deeper but focussed programming
skills. The appropriate course for them isn&amp;#39;t the same as a
general/pre-major course. Using Statistics as an example, at Hunter,
many majors require a statistics course which is off loaded to the
Stats department. Each major has slightly different requirements. Over
years, the end result is a course that it seems that nobody is happy
with - a least common denominator course. CS for All at the college level
could give us a least common denominator course that doesn&amp;#39;t serve
anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, if you have the resources, none of these are issues. A well
heeled private institution can run tons of sections of specialized
classes no problem but this means just like on the K12 level we&amp;#39;ll
get the CS for All tale of two cities that I see coming in NY where
the rich schools have good programs and the poor get a substandard
experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With all of this said, I&amp;#39;m finally getting to the big red flag with
college CS for All and it&amp;#39;s an issue that everyone conveniently
ignores. I&amp;#39;m talking about teacher quality. One of my big takeaways
from SIGCSE is that college faculty are well behind K12 teachers in
terms of pedagogy and I don&amp;#39;t see this changing anytime soon. This is
to be expected given that professor&amp;#39;s career advancement is really
based on research. Having a good teacher is always important but it&amp;#39;s
even more important for non-major students since a student in the
professor&amp;#39;s major will at least be passionate about the subject
area. To me, this is not a recipe for success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One can certainly make the claim that we aren&amp;#39;t any better off right
now at the K12 level because we don&amp;#39;t have teachers who know either
the subject nor how to teach it and at least at the college level they
know the subject matter. This is very true and it&amp;#39;s why pre-service CS
teacher preparation is so critical to getting this right even though
it will take time. That&amp;#39;s something that both Mark and I have been
vocal about but more on that subject next time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is there room for CS for All</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/room-for-csforall/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
A fear revolving around CS For All concerns where will the money
come from and how will we fit in the new classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One suggested solution is to integrate CS into other subjects. I
thought I&amp;#39;d write today about why I don&amp;#39;t think the fear is valid and
while integrating CS into other classes can have value, it probably
isn&amp;#39;t a long term solution for CS education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s start with the integration solution. The idea is to bring CS
into an existing class. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bootstrapworld.org/&#34;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;, a program I&amp;#39;ve written about before
and one of the programs I like does this, primarily in Algebra. The
idea is that this supports the student&amp;#39;s learning Algebra while
exposing them to CS. It&amp;#39;s a nice program but a math teacher using
Bootstrap shouldn&amp;#39;t be confused with a computer science
teacher. They&amp;#39;re bringing some CS to their student and engaging the
students in a different way mathematically and that&amp;#39;s all great but in
general you can&amp;#39;t take two classes worth of material and concepts and
fit them into one class and the number of teachers who are truly
knowledgable in any two academic subject areas both in content and
pedagogical content knowledge is few. I&amp;#39;m guessing that one of the
reasons that Bootstrap works in Algebra is the alignment of the
toolset and Algebra and how you can teach it. The other is that
Algebra is frequently given more time for fewer topics. In some
struggling schools, students might have two years of algebra or a
double period so there&amp;#39;s time to add in some CS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m all for cross curricular work. You can look at applications of
science in math classes, do mathy work in a CS class, run stats and
data analysis in math and CS classes on materials from History classes
and all of this is great. You can even create great combined curricula
where you do indeed teach multiple subjects in an integrated way but
to think that you can take what is typically taught in two different
classes and you can combine both so that they&amp;#39;re taught in one class
with one teacher sounds fishy to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, at the end of the day, if you go the integration approach you&amp;#39;re
either going to have to dedicate a similar set of resources both in
time and personel to having independent courses. The alternative is
that CS will be the second class subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, let&amp;#39;s look at actually bringing in CS For All as a separate
course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here are the New York State Graduation Requirements [fn::The state
lists by credits which are a year, I doubled the numbers to map to semesters]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Subject&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;Number of semesters&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;English&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Soc Studies&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Science&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Math&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;LOTE&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Arts&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Phys Ed&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Health&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Electives&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Total&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;44&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It can be difficult to fit Phys Ed in since it has to be offered every
semester so let&amp;#39;s double the Phys Ed requirement to 8 semesters. What
is actually normally done is to have 7.5 periods of science a week and
2.5 periods of Gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This means that the basic student program uses 48 class slots and
includes 7 elective slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In terms of exit exams, students have to pass the following Regents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;English&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any single math (Algebra, Geometery, Alg 2 / Trig)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any single Social Studies (US History or Global History&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any single Science (Living Env (bio), Chem, Phys, Earth Science)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any additional Regents exam&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The requirement of passing a single Math regents is what leads to the
extra time allocated to Algebra that I mentioned when discussing
integrating CS into Algebra above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To get an Advanced Regents diploma you have to pass additional exams -
both history, all three math, three science and maybe more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using a Typical 7 period plus lunch day, we have room for 56 single
semeter classes in a high school career. This means that assuming
students aren&amp;#39;t failing too many classes, even with the extra Phys Ed
allocation I mentioned above  we can easily fit computer
science into our day. In fact, we can technically fit in four full
years assuming a student doesn&amp;#39;t have to repeat any class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So in New York state we certainly have the time but what about the
budget? That&amp;#39;s not an issue either. The state also requires that
students recieve 5.5 hours of instruction a day exclusive of
lunch. At 47 minute periods, that translates to students being
assigned 7 instructional classes a day which means we can&amp;#39;t just give
the kids the required 44. We have to fill all 56 available class slots
over those four years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course it&amp;#39;s not really that simple. Students fail classes and have
to repeat them and some classes might be assigned more time than
others but it looks to me like we should be able to fit
computer science in without any big budgetary or scheduling
changes. The challenge will be finding the teacher and working the
internal politics and policies since as computer science comes in it
will mean removing some electives even if those electives are additional years
of science, math, or English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Programs like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tealsk12.org/&#34;&gt;TEALS&lt;/a&gt; and Bootstrap are important transitional programs
and even when we do have qualified CS teachers they will play an
important role - TEALS in providing industry support and resources and
Bootstrap by integrating curricular areas and over time as preservice
programs start to appear the rest will work itself out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unfunded Mandates and CS For All</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/unfunded-mandates/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/unfunded-mandates/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
This morning, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/guzdial&#34;&gt;Mark Guzdial&lt;/a&gt; wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;https://computinged.wordpress.com/2018/04/27/lack-of-funding-leads-to-lack-of-teachers-leads-to-lack-of-cs-classes-we-may-need-to-change-our-strategy/&#34;&gt;unfunded mandates and CS for
All&lt;/a&gt;. Unfunded mandates frequently wreak havoc on schools in a number
of ways but in the long run, I don&amp;#39;t think it should have a severe
effect on CS for All. Rather, it could have a big impact on the number
of CS courses we offer beyond that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Mark relay&amp;#39;s a story from the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School where
at the time many students wanted more CS classes but the school wasn&amp;#39;t
planning on hiring a new CS teacher. The money quote is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 50 percent of students signing up for Level 2 [computer science] courses next year identify as African Americans,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
No, I&amp;#39;m not talking about the diversity issue raised by the quote, I&amp;#39;m
talking about &lt;strong&gt;Level 2 [computer science]&lt;/strong&gt;. This implies that the
students already had &lt;strong&gt;Level 1 computer science&lt;/strong&gt;. Level 1 would cover
CS For All so now we&amp;#39;re talking about CS electives vs other
electives. This is something I had to deal with for most of my career
even after we got a CS requirement at Stuy. It was always a battle to
hire enough CS teachers to meet demand. The hard part was politics -
there were always older more entrenched subject areas who would rather
force kids into their electives rather than allow them to take my CS
electives. This is a whole other kettle of fish than CS for All. It&amp;#39;s
an issue for some schools now and will become a &lt;strong&gt;BIG&lt;/strong&gt; issue in five to
fifteen years when a single CS required course is more the norm. The
issue raised here is a new CS elective vs entrenched teachers and
classes which shuld lead to a discussion of the relative value of CS
electives vs other electives. That said, the reality is that it
usually comes down to school and local power and politics. Also to be
considered is the potential ebb and flow of interest - there might be
demand for 5 more CS classes and 5 less something else this year but
there might not be next year and then we&amp;#39;re in real trouble staffing
wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Schools, public high schools in particular are zero sum endeavors. You
have a fixed number of periods a day, specific class requirements, and
certain mandates as to a the minimum and maximum number of classes a
student can take. In New York City, I believe students are required to
have a &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; schedule which basically means they can&amp;#39;t come in for
English, Math, and History and then go home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With CS for All, you&amp;#39;re basically allocating reallocating some amount
of time to computer science. It might be hard to find a qualified
teacher. particularly in a small school where the population won&amp;#39;t
support a full time CS teacher and it might ruffle the feathers of the
teachers that will be losing the time but it shouldn&amp;#39;t make much of a
dent or really any dent on the budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Mark also raises the possibility of embedding CS into other subject
classes. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bootstrapworld.org/&#34;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; is a program that I&amp;#39;m rather fond of that does
just this in Algebra classes (although more recently they&amp;#39;re working
to branch out into other subject areas). Even though I&amp;#39;m a big
Bootstrap fan I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s the answer to CS for All or CS in
the high schools in general. I think that one of the reasons why
Bootstrap works so well is the alignment between the CS tool they use
and the way Algebra is or can be taught. Another reason is the fact
that while Algebra is the lowest level of the traditional high school
classes, it&amp;#39;s frequently the one for which the most time is
allocated. Students in low performing schools might take Algebra over
two years or have a double period. This won&amp;#39;t be the case for other
subject areas. What this means is that there&amp;#39;s more likely extra time
to embed another subject, cs, into the Algebra class. Long term,
embedding CS into another subject area requires:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a teacher that really knows both subjects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;enough time so you can add all the cool CS content while still&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;preparing the students for both the next level of whatever subject
you&amp;#39;re embedded in  as well as for whatever standardized
assessments come at the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I said, I&amp;#39;m a Bootstrap fan but I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s the answer for
CS in K12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back to the original topic there are certainly issues with
implementing CS for All but I don&amp;#39;t think school funding is the
biggest hurdle. For me there are other big challenges. One is having a
supply of qualified teachers. In the long run as states outline CS
requirements and pre-service programs crop up this will work itself
out. Until then, yes, we will have an issue and yes it will take some
funding for stop gap and transitional teacher preperation. A second issue is
working the internal politics. Adding CS does mean removing something
else or more likely a piece of something else. The third one is what
I&amp;#39;m noticing in NY where CS for all seems to at times forget about
the CS. If we have knowledgeable teachers we can work around that one
but I still think that might be my biggest concern.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pull Requests and Other People&#39;s Code</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/pull-requests/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/pull-requests/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
One of the things I&amp;#39;ve heard for years from former students - both
those looking for jobs and those looking to hire is that colleges
don&amp;#39;t really do a good job preparing students for careers in
tech. Sure they teach the algorithms and the theory but ther are a lot
of missing pieces, particularly on the practical end. I&amp;#39;m certainly
not advocating turning CS programs into coding schools but there are
many low cost opportunities to bring practical real world best
practices in to the CS classroom. I most recently wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/testing-part2%0A&#34;&gt;unit
testing&lt;/a&gt; and had earlier about using &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/sigcse-2017-github-4&#34;&gt;GitHub as an educational
tool&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;ve been happy with the way I introduce students to Git and
how we use GitHub in my classes but I&amp;#39;ve never found a smooth way to
introduce Pull Requests. A pull request is basically a mechanism by
which one can suggest a change to a project even if you don&amp;#39;t own
it. The project owner can then decide to merge it in or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Being comfortable with the pull request work flow is an important part
of contributing to open source projects. The basic process is that you
make a copy of the project you want to work on by forking it, make
your changes, then issue a pull request back to the project. For a
beginner, there are a lot of moving parts. Instead, I teach my
students branching and merging within a project. It&amp;#39;s much easier and
arguably more useful for day to day projects. I&amp;#39;d like my kid to learn the
pull request mechanics but I haden&amp;#39;t thought of a good way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve also wanted to give kids more real world experiences in class and
one experience they rarely get is working in other people&amp;#39;s code
bases. In school you largely write your own projects be they group or
solo or work off a hopefully tried and true code base provided by the
instructor. In the real world you&amp;#39;re frequently working off of someone
elses code and it&amp;#39;s rarely in a polished state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I finally found a way to kill both birds with one stone. A couple of
weeks ago my class&amp;#39; lab was rather lengthy. It involved reading in a
source file and reformating it in a sensible way. I knew most of the
students wouldn&amp;#39;t finish it in the allotted time and even if they did,
this was an easy assignment to extend. On lab day I had students
create a new repo for this lab (normally they just add a folder in a
their &amp;#34;labs&amp;#34; repo) and get as much done as they could. The rule was
simple - push what you&amp;#39;ve got up to GitHub at the end of class and
then you can&amp;#39;t push anything else. I also made it clear that I didn&amp;#39;t
expect a completed lab..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We continued the lab in the next class session. This time. I randomly
assigned repos to students so that they would fork someone elses
lab. They then had to complete the lab on the other students code base
and then issue a pull request back to the original&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This was the first time I&amp;#39;ve tried this so it was a little
klunky. I&amp;#39;ll do a much better job specifying the assignment and
instructions next time around but even so I think the class went
well. By the end of the class the students had sucesfully forked a
project, issued a pull request, and merged one in to their own
project. The only think I wasn&amp;#39;t happy with was that many of the
merges happened automatically. I have to figure out how to set things
up so that there are merge conflicts since I want my students to
experience that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Overall,  I was very happy with the way things worked out. The
students were able to experience important real workd software
engineering techniques without removing any of the academic CS in the
class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I tweeted this the other day:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Why don&amp;#39;t so many  teachers and professors understand that the test or assignment you can do in 15 minutes will take your beginning students at least an hour and probably a lot more to complete.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Mike Zamansky (@zamansky) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/zamansky/status/986609723557404673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;April 18, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What led to the tweet was a discussion I was having with some students
about not having enough time on tests which led to a discussion of
having to drop everything to spend every waking hour on a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s talk about tests.
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m not saying that tests are the best forms of assessment - most of
the time I&amp;#39;d much rather have students work on projects. There are,
however, times when tests make sense or are otherwise appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any event, writing a test is hard. Rather, writing good test is
hard. It&amp;#39;s certianly easy enough to put a bunch of multiple choice or
short answer questions on paper and it&amp;#39;s easy enough to give a hard
equation to solve or some code to write but creating a good test is a
task and half. You first have to figure out what you&amp;#39;re trying to
assess - memory, thought process, synthesizing concepts? Then you want
to construct questions that give you insights into your students
knowledge and thought process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some things that I consider when putting together a test:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it ramp up in difficulty - that is, are there some &amp;#34;gimme&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;questions&amp;#34; and some challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are questions all or nothing - if a kid doesn&amp;#39;t see things my way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;are they dead in the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will the test repeatedly penalize or reward the same concept over&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and over again on the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I cover all the concepts I want to assess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you make kids waste time with boilerplate code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do the questions take so long to read and digest that there&amp;#39;s little&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;time to form and write down answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do the answers convey anything about the students thought process or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;just correctness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it easy or impossible to grade and grade fairly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about length? To me a well crafted test should be completed by
the average student with a few minutes to spare - enough time to check
a couple of answers. This is not to say that they&amp;#39;ll ace the exam,
just finish it. Far too many teachers make tests an assessment of
speed and accuracy at speed rather than understanding. That might
actually be important in certain contexts - preparing for the APCS-A
multiple choice section as an example but in general, it&amp;#39;s not a good
way of assessing what a student really knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s also important that the the average student can achieve a score
that you expect from an average student. That&amp;#39;s probably in the 80s on
a 0-100 scale or a B. Yes, I know, C is supposed to be average but
with grade inflation being what it is…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You should &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; give an assessment where the average score is
something like 17 out of 100 with the top student earning a 37. Sure,
you can curve it but it also places a lot of stress on the
students. You might do this from time to time - you might misjudge the
difficulty of a test or your class but it shouldn&amp;#39;t be a regular
occurence. Teachers sometimes forget about the psychological affect
that a unfair test can have on a student even if the teacher &amp;#34;fixes&amp;#34; it
after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
Don&amp;#39;t be afraid to experiment or have some fun.
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s also ok to try different things. One year, having just completed
a unit on Cellualar Automata I decided to give a quiz. I figured it
would take the kids 10 to 15 minutes so I gave them 30. The quiz was
something like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have 30 minutes to compose something on a sheet of paper that when
I review it convinces me that you know something about the Cellular
Automata Unit we just completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some kids loved the quiz, some hated it. The ones that hated it had
been trained for years as expert standardized test takers and this
level of freedom really freaked the out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another time, I gave a multi page test of serious questions mixed with
crazy shenanigans. Question one would be some CS problem followed by
some instructions like &amp;#34;stand up, do 5 jumping jacks and sit down&amp;#34; or
&amp;#34;shout out your favorite olde timey exclamation&amp;#34; or even &amp;#34;stand up, if
or when you see another student standing, switch seats with the and
continue the test.&amp;#34; The test started with explicit instructions not to
read ahead but to read and do each question in order. The last page
was the answer key and I asked the kids to self-grade. Interestingly
enough the grading was pretty honest. After that one, I received a few
apology emails from kids who read to the end first encouraging me to
give them failing grades for cheating. Wow, I wasn&amp;#39;t expecting
that. The test was something of an end of year goof. The CS questions
were really easy - I wanted to reward them with something silly and
easy - a guaranteed A after a year of hard work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-3&#34;&gt;
Tests to drive instruction and future practice
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a final point to ponder, tests shouldn&amp;#39;t only be about grades. A
well crafted test should drive instruction. Kids will get answers
wrong - will your questions be crafted so that you can gain insights
into why the got them wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In an early class you might notice things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;kids printing rather than returning answers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;kids not understanding scope&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;kids having difficulty with idioms like &lt;code&gt;i=i+1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;kids needing more scaffolding to approach a problem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can drive instruction moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Over time you&amp;#39;ll also learn how to fine tune your tests and other
assessments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-4&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-4&#34;&gt;
Next time, we&amp;#39;ll talk about projects
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-4&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Unless of course I get distracted by another blog topic or shiny
object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Using Emacs 48 Silversearcher</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-48-silversearcher/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 22 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-48-silversearcher/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
A couple of days ago I wrote about on my &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/unit-tests-grading-workflow&#34;&gt;lab grading workflow&lt;/a&gt;. In the
post I mentioned that I used Emacs to easily navigate between student
folders and files so I can actually look at their work in addition to
their programs output and test results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The key is a combination of &lt;code&gt;dired&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Wilfred/ag.el&#34;&gt;ag&lt;/a&gt;, Emacs&amp;#39;s interface to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher&#34;&gt;the
Silver Searcher&lt;/a&gt; which is something like a recursive code grep on
steroids. I also briefly try to show &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mhayashi1120/Emacs-wgrep&#34;&gt;wgrep&lt;/a&gt; in the video which allows
you to edit Emacs grep buffers, effectively allowing you to make
changes across a set of files all at once. It ended up not working
with silversearcher - if anyone out there knows why, please chime in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Enjoy:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>No Magic Bullets - Discovery Learning</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/no-magic-bullets-constructivism/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 21 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/no-magic-bullets-constructivism/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The most recent NYC CSTA chapter meeting was &amp;#34;How do I assess CS?&amp;#34; I
wanted to go but it&amp;#39;s been such a crazy month I was just too wiped
out. Fortunately, the meetup was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIMKAZbHAiA&amp;amp;index=83&amp;amp;list=WL&amp;amp;t=1796s&#34;&gt;recorded&lt;/a&gt;. I was able to watch the
first half this morning while working out on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.staczero.com/hero&#34;&gt;stationary trainer&lt;/a&gt;
which leads me to today&amp;#39;s rare Saturday morning blog
post. The meetup consisted of two panels. The first was made up of K12
teachers who taught CS. I can&amp;#39;t talk about the second panel yet since I&amp;#39;m
only halfway through but there were a couple of points made by my
friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/KatieJergens&#34;&gt;Katie Jergens&lt;/a&gt; who teaches at Dalton that I thought were worth
talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first was when Katie noted that through working with the panel,
one of her takeaways was that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving students an explicit strategy for solving a problem - &amp;#34;this is
how I would do it….,&amp;#34; - giving them an explicit strategy first and then giving them a
problem for which that strategy would apply is much more effective than
having them discover it on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This was refreshing to hear after being beaten over the head on
discovery learning and constructivism for the past five or so
years as being the magic bullet for teachers. I shared more thoughts
on this a few weeks ago when I wrote about a SIGCSE paper presented by
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/sigcse2018-bootstrap/&#34;&gt;Bootstrap World&lt;/a&gt; that I very much liked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Katie went on to talk about how the group found that while &amp;#34;discovery
learning&amp;#34; can be effective it can also be frustrating and lose kids
along the way. It also takes a lot of time and preparation, something
that&amp;#39;s short on supply in most public schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This made me think about the recent flurry
of discussion around the debunking of learning styles which had
previously been the magic bullet. When I started, the secret sauce was cooperative
learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course any good teacher knows there&amp;#39;s no magic bullet. You fill
your tool belt and chest with as much as you can and use what&amp;#39;s
best based on your strengths as a teacher combined with what will work
best with your students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another point that Katie made that I found refreshing had to do with
something she does with her classes. A good portion of a student&amp;#39;s grade is
based on what she calls a &amp;#34;booster.&amp;#34; Each student has to work one on
one with her on some project. The student either scores a 0 or a 100 -
the student keeps working with the direct support of the teacher until
it&amp;#39;s perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The important thing that Katie said with respect to this is &amp;#34;I can
do this because my largest class is sixteen students.&amp;#34; No way could
this ever scale to a public school where a teacher can meet with over
150 students a day and barely has time eat lunch let alone
work one on one with a student in a suitably quiet place like an
office. The refreshing thing to hear was the acknowledgment of the
fact that what works in a rich private school won&amp;#39;t work in a public
school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All to often education and yes, CS Ed is driven by people who
really have no clue. They&amp;#39;re anointed as thought leaders but they
don&amp;#39;t walk the walk. Some have some knowledge and experience but many
don&amp;#39;t. Until you&amp;#39;ve gotten a few years under your belt in a strap
cashed public school that takes all comers, don&amp;#39;t tell them how they
should do it. Katie didn&amp;#39;t - she acknowledged the problem - too bad so
many others don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m looking forward to watching the rest of the video during a future
workout and might have more to share then. For now, take a look for
yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unit Tests Grading Workflow</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/unit-tests-grading-workflow/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/unit-tests-grading-workflow/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve talked before about unit testing (&lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/testing-testing&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/testing-part2&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). My premise is
that in addition to being an important industry technique, it&amp;#39;s a
sound practice for students studying CS. I also contend that it can
make grading easier on the teacher. Maybe not as easy as an
auto-grader but those have &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-10-16-graders.html/#.WtplHHXwZhE&#34;&gt;their own problems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since I spent most of today grading I thought I&amp;#39;d share my current
workflow and how unit tests have made me more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have each student make a single GitHub repo for all individual
homeworks, labs and small projects. They&amp;#39;ll make additional repos for
larger and group projects. They fill out a Google form to give me the
repo link. I download the form and end up with a CSV file something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-csv&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-csv&#34; data-lang=&#34;csv&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-csv&#34; data-lang=&#34;csv&#34;&gt;Doe, John, git@github.com:johndoe/mymoework.git
Doe, Jane, git@github.com:janedoe/labs.git
etc.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My goal is to clone each students repo into a directory and then
throughout the term, they add assignments to their own repos using the
names and specifications I give them. For example, after assigning
three assignments, I could pull everything from their repos and I
would have a directory structure something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;example&#34;&gt;
hw
├── doe_jane
│   ├── hw_01
│   ├── hw_02
│   └── hw_03
│
└── doe_john
├── hw_01
└── hw_02
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To get there, I have to change the csv file to a small shell script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-bash&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;git clone git@github.com:johndoe/mymoework.git doe_john
git clone git@github.com:janedoe/labs.git doe_jane
etc.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I usually do this in Emacs with a macro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now I&amp;#39;m ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Whenever there&amp;#39;s a new assignment, I just have to update all the
repos. I go into the root hw directory and loop through all the
subdirectoryes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-bash&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;cs /path/to/hw_root
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; i in &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;ls&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
cd /path/to/hw_root/$i
git pull
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At this point I could go into each repo but we can do better. Since I
have all of my students submit a Makefile with a default target to
build an executable named &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; and also a target named &lt;code&gt;tests&lt;/code&gt; which
will build an executable to run the unit tests named &lt;code&gt;tests&lt;/code&gt; I do this
instead of a straight pull:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-bash&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;cs /path/to/hw_root
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; i in &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;ls&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
cd /path/to/hw_root/$i
git pull
cd hw_03 &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# or whatever assignment I&amp;#39;m grading&lt;/span&gt;
make tests
make
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, if I want, I can go into each directory, run the tests by typing
&lt;code&gt;./tests&lt;/code&gt;  and the hw or project with &lt;code&gt;./main&lt;/code&gt;. I can also add a
couple of lines to the for loop above like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-bash&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;echo &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;$i&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt; Test Report\n----------------\n&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /path/to/hw_root/test_report
./tests &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /path/to/hw_root/test_rport
echo &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;----------------------\n\n&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This gives me a single file with everyone&amp;#39;s test results. Either by
doing this or by running the tests in each folder manually I can
quickly see what works and what doesn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While I&amp;#39;m doing this, I have Emacs up and with &lt;strong&gt;dired mode&lt;/strong&gt; and more
specifically &lt;strong&gt;ag-dired-regexp&lt;/strong&gt; which lets me easily
navigate to any student&amp;#39;s files. Combined with the test results I can
quickly evaluate the entire assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Put all of this together and it makes grading somewhat bearable. I can
work through well written, correct assignments extremely quickly and
drill down into the other projects efficiently as well.&lt;/p&gt;
