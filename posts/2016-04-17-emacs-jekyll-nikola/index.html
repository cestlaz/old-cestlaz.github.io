Switched over from [[https://jekyllrb.com/][Jekyll]] to [[https://getnikola.com/][Nikola]] yesterday.

One of the primary reasons was that I got fed up with managing a Ruby
development environment across all my machines. In spite of my
rantings, I'm sure Ruby and Ruby installs are fine - it's just
something that I'd have to deal with on a recurring basis for one
specific task - other than for Jekyll blogging, I don't use Ruby.

So while a platform based on Python - generally my go to language,
made sense, the other driving force for the switch was the fact that
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] and [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] have become such major parts of my workflow and
productivity.

What do I use org-mode for?
- lesson planning
- document preparation (instead of LaTeX)
- note taking
- blogging
- email (with mu4e)
- managing my schedule
- tracking bookmarks

and probably a lot more.

Jekyll is actually a really nice tool. It's simple. You put together a
simple directory structure: Templates in _layouts, blog posts in
_posts, drafts in _drafts. Other directories that start with an
underscore are ignored and everything else is copied up to your site.

I love that it's "close to the metal" You can put in html files with
some meta information up top or markdown.

You can take a look at my old site at
[[https://github.com/cestlaz/cestlaz.github.io-jekyll][https://github.com/cestlaz/cestlaz.github.io-jekyll]] if you want to
take a look.

The beauty is that you just push your files up to GitHub and it
automatically runs Jekyll and builds your site ([[https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/][more info here]]).

The problem is that Jekyll doesn't play well with org-mode and
org-markup so my workflow became something like this

1. Create a post **something.org** in the _org directory.
2. From within emacs, publish it. I've configured org-mode to publish
by exporting the org-mode markup file to html and saving it in the
_drafts directory.
3. If it looks good, copy and rename the file from _drafts to the
_posts directory and push it up to GitHub.

A little clunky, but it works. The bigger problem was the amount of
time I'd spend putting html blocks into my org formatted posts to get
them to look the way I wanted (or at least close enough).

Enter Nikola.

Nikola's a much more powerful tool. It does much more but as a result
is much more complex. Normally, that's not my style but in this case
since It's Python, things balance out.

I still have to figure out the entire templating system and all the
plugins but getting started was pretty quick.

The big win is that Nikola supports a ton of formats for your posts
and pages. Native org-mode support for me was what did it for me. On top of
that, although I haven't tested it yet, is that there's also an
org-mode plugin to export to Nikola restructure text.

My new workflow:

1. Write the post as an org-mode file.
2. run **nikola github\under{}deploy**.

And that's it. You can look at my Nikola site here:
[[https://github.com/cestlaz/cestlaz.github.io][https://github.com/cestlaz/cestlaz.github.io]].
The source code is in the **src** branch, the actual rendered blog in
the **master** branch.

So far, I'm pretty happy with the setup.
