      <description>Just like last year, I&amp;#39;m taking in two classes worth of students in to my honors program. The challenge is that I can only teach two classes and I&amp;#39;ve got to figure out what to teach and then which students belong in which class.  It basically comes down to one of two courses, our CS0 (CSCI127) and our CS1 (CSCI135).  CSCI127 is a first programming experience. The normal class is taught as a large lecture with small recitation/labs.</description>
