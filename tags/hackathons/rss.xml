      <description>Today I got to be a judge at StuyHacks VIII. This isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve been a judge there, I&#39;ve been doing it for a few years now. I&#39;ve also been lucky enought to have been asked to judge a handful of other local hackathons over the years.
StuyHacks is a high school hackathon organized and run by students at Stuyvesant High School. Since it&#39;s run by students, the cast of organizers regularly changes.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I was one of the judges at StuyHacks. A one day hackathon at Stuyvesant run by and organized by the students. I don&#39;t have attendee stats but there were kids from all over the city and at least one team from New Jersey. The youngest student that I met was in sixth grade and the oldest were high school seniors. The judging was at the end but I decided to stop by earlier to see how the hackers were doing.</description>
