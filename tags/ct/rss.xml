      <description>Last week I spent a couple of days as part of a team running professional development for a group of pre and in service elementary school teachers. Two days talking about computational thinking.  Wait a minute - elementary school teachers? I&amp;#39;m a high school guy pretending to be a college guy. My extensive experience with elementary school education is that I raised two kids and I don&amp;#39;t think I messed them up too much.</description>

      <description>The theme of this year&amp;#39;s To Code and Beyond was Computational Thinking. Mark Guzdial gave the keynote. While the talk isn&amp;#39;t currently online, check out this talk that Mark gave last March. It&amp;#39;s not the same but the second halves are and well worth a look.  In the first half, Mark talked about other types of &amp;#34;thinking.&amp;#34; Scientific thinking, engineering thinking and even historical thinking. All had a good amount of overlap with both each other and with computational thinking even as we haven&amp;#39;t yet settled on what computational thinking actually is.</description>

      <description>Today was the fifth &amp;#34;To Code and Beyond&amp;#34; - a one day conference hosted at Cornell Technion and once again Diane Levitt put together a great show. The theme was Computational Thinking and the day consisted of a variety of talks, panels, and activities. I plan on writing about one panel in particular but for today I wanted to address something that came up as a question. One attendee asked a panel about the achievement gap - the fact that when the CS movement got started in NY some of the more innovative and interesting work was being done with some of our most vulnerable students.</description>
