      <title>Learning a new language - part 1 - functional</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Now that I&amp;#39;ve done posting about &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/retiring-1-why/&#34;&gt;why I&amp;#39;m retiring&lt;/a&gt; we can get back to
our usual blogging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I haven&amp;#39;t really done anything technical over the past couple of
year. The most programming I did in the past 18 months was a
halfhearted effort at the Advent of Code 2021 event last December. I
thought I&amp;#39;d see about picking up a new language to change that. In
doing so, I was reminded of some of my resistances to learning a new
language and how I&amp;#39;ve seen similar from self taught students coming
into my classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course my situation is different - I&amp;#39;m doing this wholly by choice
and once a student is in a class they&amp;#39;ve got to use the prescribed
tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The contenders on the functional side were Haskell and OCaml and on the
other side, mostly Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today, we&amp;#39;ll talk about the functional side. I decided to look at
OCaml. I had briefly looked at it well over a decade ago but barely
scratched the surface. Haskell I played with a little more deeply but
not much. I decided on OCaml because it was supposed to be more real
world and, to be honest, I get turned off by some of the holier than
though purely functional talk that sometimes occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Funny thing is that I&amp;#39;ve had a really hard time getting going - so
much so that I decided that for now I&amp;#39;d explore Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, what&amp;#39;s going on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
OCaml looks to have some nice features. It&amp;#39;s functional and I&amp;#39;m a fan
there and it&amp;#39;s also supposed to be pragmatic - you can get real world
stuff done with it. It&amp;#39;s also statically typed which overall I think
is a good thing and it has cool features like pattern matching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For pattern matching, I&amp;#39;m not talking about things like regex or
matching characters in a string but rather something like a really
cool and powerful case or switch statement. Even that description,
though is not doing it justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think my problem is that I already am comfortable and enjoy
programming in Clojure. Clojure is functional and pragmatic but while
Clojure doesn&amp;#39;t have pattern matching built in but there is a library
that basically accomplishes the same thing. As to the type system,
Clojure is dynamically typed and while that would be an issue if I
were working on large real projects and/or on a team, I&amp;#39;m just writing
little toys by myself. If I want stronger typing, there are ways of
doing that in Clojure. True, it&amp;#39;s not required but working by myself,
I have that option, should I choose. It&amp;#39;s not the same - I know but as
I said, I&amp;#39;m not doing anything big, important or with other people
right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, basically, every time I try to dive in to OCaml, I end up feeling
that &amp;#34;I can already do that and do it better in Clojure.&amp;#34; I&amp;#39;m guessing
I&amp;#39;d feel the reverse had I started on the OCaml side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This has happened to me before. I was an early Python adopter feeling
that it was a huge improvement over Perl. A while later, Ruby came out
and shortly after that, Ruby on Rails became a thing. Every time I
looked into Ruby I had to stop - I could already do and do better in
Python. By then, there were enough tools to compete with Rails even
though they weren&amp;#39;t as mainstream and overall I preferred Python. I
never did end up learning Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I felt a similar sluggishness when I went from C++ to Java - something
I had to do because of the AP Exam change but I pushed through since I
had to teach it and ultimately, I&amp;#39;ve learned to appreciate the good
and curse the bad of both languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve seen similar blocks or resistance from who&amp;#39;ve had prior
programming experiences over the years. From students who seemed
to be taught more &amp;#34;the language&amp;#34; rather than CS using the language. I
know that&amp;#39;s a nebulous thing to say but I think some of you will catch
my drift. It&amp;#39;s subtleties like saying &amp;#34;okay, we&amp;#39;re repeating this
process, here&amp;#39;s how we do it in language such and such&amp;#34; vs &amp;#34;here&amp;#39;s how
we repeat this process period&amp;#34; and show the language construct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My former math chairman at Stuy said he once, back in the 80s asked Marvin
Minsky what they should be teaching for CS in High School. Minsky
said, and I paraphrase, &amp;#34;nothing, you&amp;#39;ll only mess them up. At most
teach them to type.&amp;#34; Of course that was a different time and I
&lt;strong&gt;strongly&lt;/strong&gt; disagree with that statement but I do think we have to look
at how students entering our classes are or are not prepared and
adjust accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, in the end, it&amp;#39;s back to Clojure for me on the functional side and
I&amp;#39;ll try to do an OCaml dive sometime in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fortunately, I&amp;#39;m having an easier time getting in to Rust. More about
that next time.&lt;/p&gt;
