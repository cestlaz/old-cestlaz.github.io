      <description>Do we really need CS focused high schools?
That&#39;s the question Alfred Thompson asked partly in reaction to my post talking about Bill Gates&#39; visit to AFSE, a NYC public school with a CS focus.
On both posts, Michael Preston shared some important and good points about AFSE as a starting point and gateway that helped lead to CS4All in NYC and also specifically about AFSE.
In response to Alfred&#39;s question I thought it was time I shared a bit about what I was pushing for AFSE back when I was involved.</description>
