      <description>First day back after a break is always hard. By the last day of vacation, I&#39;m actually sleeping a little later and shifting the body clock back is rather harsh. It&#39;s tough enough getting started again, but it&#39;s even worse when you&#39;re thrown a curve ball. I got in at my usual 7:00, made my coffee, and started getting my lessons ready for the day. At about 7:30 we lost power in half of the room.</description>
