      <title>Selecting a starting language - why not Javascript</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I was catching up with the team at Stuy the other day and they
mentioned that they were periodically getting pushback on their choice
of languages, particularly in the intro class. The pushback was mostly
in the form of &amp;#34;why don&amp;#39;t you start them with Javascript?&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back in the day, when I created our intro class where we use Scheme,
NetLogo and then later Python, I&amp;#39;d get similar pushback but then it
was &amp;#34;why not Java?&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;why not C?&amp;#34;, or &amp;#34;whu not C++?&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We had a good discussion on this and I shared my thoughts as to why I
don&amp;#39;t like Javascript as a first language and I thought I&amp;#39;d share some
of them here. I&amp;#39;ll try to get around to the rationale behind Scheme
and NetLogo in a later post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To start, let me say that I &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Javascript -
particularly when approaching it as a functional language. I also
think every school and situation is different so there are likely
times when Javascript is the right beginner language for the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s dive in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why are some of the pluses for Javascript as an intro language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ubiquity and availability:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a browser, you have Javascript - it&amp;#39;s also available
through online IDEs and online lightweight sites like &lt;a href=&#34;https://jsfiddle.net/&#34;&gt;JSFiddle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interactivity:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can tweak websites almost live, use the HTML5 canvas pretty
interactively and mode&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s mainstream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s quick to get up and running&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all true, but there are also downsides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of my big problems with Javascript is the lack of simple solid
educational tooling. I love to use tools like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.drjava.org/&#34;&gt;DrJava&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://drpython.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;DrPython&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://racket-lang.org/&#34;&gt;Racket&lt;/a&gt; (formerly DrScheme) with beginners. All simple learning
IDEs. True, you can use a simple online IDE but I haven&amp;#39;t found them
to have as strong a learning interface. They also, generally, keep you
in an oversimplified programming sandbox. There&amp;#39;s no clean transition
from the sandbox to the real deal - particularly given the non-trivial
state of js build tools and environments. These simple learning IDEs
set the stage and then we can transition to more powerful development environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also prefer, where possible, to have kids learn locally so that they
can learn something about the underlying operating system even if
only at a user level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A problem relating to the lack of tooling is the fact that a JS
program can fail to run and not give you any meaningful feedback at
all - this is a problem for a beginner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Javascript also has all sorts of wonkiness. We have &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;
which is pretty conventional, but then there&amp;#39;s also &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt;. We have
potentially confusing scoping issues and also some other real
weirdness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-js&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-js&#34; data-lang=&#34;js&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For more, check out the this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;. Start watching at about 1:20 -
it&amp;#39;s a riot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All of this weirdness actually makes sense - just not to a beginner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Javascript also gives plenty of freedom - there are many ways to do
things. This can be great for the developer but not necessarily ideal
for the learner. Loops, recursion, mapping functions - you name it,
Javascript&amp;#39;s got it. I like simpler languages for beginners because
it&amp;#39;s easier to get them thinking and problem solving in certain ways
when there tool set is somewhat restricted (more on that when I write
about Scheme).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, the fact that Javascript&amp;#39;s a mainstream language can be a
minus. Given its popularity, a beginner class could have at  least a
few kid who&amp;#39;ve at least played with the language. This can lead them
to think they know more than they do and more importantly, this can
be intimidating to the real newbies who develop the impression that
&amp;#34;everyone knows this but me.&amp;#34; A less mainstream language puts everyone
on a level playing field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let me say again that I love javascript as a language and before a
student graduates Stuy they can learn all about Javascript, front end
development, some functional programming, and more. It&amp;#39;s just not the
right language to start with - at least not at Stuy.&lt;/p&gt;
