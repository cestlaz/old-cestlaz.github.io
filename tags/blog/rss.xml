      <description>While setting up my Pinebook Pro I wanted to make sure I could write blog posts. Go and Hugo installed and ran no problem but I switched to Hugo in April 2020 back when it was version .49 or something like that. Now it&amp;#39;s up to .73. It turns out there have been a few changes. First, I set up my blog with two directories for posts. One for the posts I wrote originally in Jekyll and one for the ones I wrote for Hugo.</description>
