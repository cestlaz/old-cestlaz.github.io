      <description>While busy finishing off my sides for my talk at CSTA2018 this weekend I noticed a Facebook post about APCS exam grades now or shortly being available.
I&#39;m no longer teaching high school but still fancy myself a teacher first and part of the K12CS community. We&#39;re a growing community and we&#39;re growing fast.
Usually, at this time of year we see a number of people posting their results. &#34;I had 16 test takers, had 5 fives, 6 fours etc.</description>
