        There were a bunch of threads on the 10X Developer recently. You know - that mythical beast that&#39;s 10 times more productive than the regular software engineer. I didn&#39;t see any of the original threads but I&#39;m guessing they started with &#34;your startup needs them&#34; and then moved to the &#34;they can&#39;t work with anyone&#34; along with tons of fun tongue and cheek 1X engineer tweets.
 It got me thinking about 10X students.

        I&#39;m a big fan of E Ink e-readers. I had one a number of years ago. An Aztak EZ Reader. It was great. Small, cheap, and independent - that is, not tied in to Amazon or Barnes and Nobles and I found myself doing a lot more recreational reading with it. I still preferred paper for technical books but for easy reading there was nothing like having tons of reading options always available.

        I&#39;m glad it&#39;s Saturday morning. It&#39;s been a busy week. It looks like there&#39;s a couple more to plough through but hopefully then I can catch my breath over spring break.
 Why so busy? It&#39;s the same old story - you&#39;ve got all those projects that you&#39;re waiting on and everything comes in at the same time.
 To start off, it&#39;s college decision season. The high school seniors all know their options and are deciding where to go.

 Got a new monitor today and wanted to share.
 My old one was a 27&#34; Hanns G. Actually, the old ones - my old set up was 2 of them side by side. When I started at Hunter, I was given a piddly small monitor so I tried to buy my own 27&#34; Hanns G to bring in but they were no longer available.

        One of the side benefits of visiting high schools is that I end up going all over the city. This takes me to neighborhoods that I normally wouldn&#39;t have reason to visit. For a New York History wonk that can be pretty cool even if you just limit yourself to looking at the schools. A few of the schools I visited in the last couple of weeks before the new year were self contained whole building schools:

I get up really early and so don&#39;t usually stay up late and more to the point, as any teacher knows, the year really goes from September through June with that really long much needed weekend that you regular folks call July and August tacked on to separate years.
 This whole January first thing is really more of a half time break or perhaps an intermission.

        Two weekends ago I took a group of my first year students up to Catskills Conf, an annual event that I describe as &#34;light tech conference with a focus on diversity and inclusion meets summer camp.&#34; I&#39;ve written about the event before if anyone&#39;s interested in more details. As in past years, Devorah ran her knitting for good project. In each of the first two years of the project, attendees of Catskills Conf learned how to know and collectively knit, crocheted and assembled a blanket for Project Linux which provides hand made blankets to children in crisis.

        Once again, it&#39;s time for Advent of Code - a series of small programming problems released once a day.
 I wrote a bit about it last year and you can still find last years problems here.
 It&#39;s only day three but so far, all of the problems look really nice for students in APCS-A or any similar intro course. I&#39;m thinking of looking at a couple of the problems this week with my class at Hunter.

One of the better kept secrets in New York City is Hunter College's computer science program. It's been around for years and it's been that way for years. In fact, when I was looking to get my masters degree back in the mid nineties I carefully researched all of the area's MS in CS programs.

To Stuy, I'm an interchangeable, generic math teacher and the DOE has shown no interested in supporting what we've built.
