        I&#39;ve been dropping mentions of this here and there for a while now but I think it&#39;s time to come out more formally -
 I&#39;m planning on retiring from Hunter at the end of this Spring.
 This doesn&#39;t mean getting out of the CS or CS Ed game entirely - I could stay on in a part time capacity and, after some decompression I think I still have things to offer but the plan is retire, collect my pension, and then see where I can continue to be contribute to the Ed/CS Ed scene.

        Hunter College, like most colleges and universities is facing unprecedented demand for CS. It&#39;s the hot major. Being a public college, we have an obligation to provide the best education possible to as many students as we can in our locality. This means we can&#39;t just put a GPA requirement or other cap on the major and we can&#39;t do things I&#39;ve heard &#34;elite&#34; schools do like essentially making applicants apply to the major direct from HS.

        It&#39;s fall so for HS teachers who taught juniors last year it&#39;s recommendation writing season. For many of those teachers, they&#39;re already well into the season with early decision deadlines being as early as November 1.
 Writing recs is one thing I don&#39;t miss now that I&#39;m working at the college level. Sure, it was always an honor to be asked but it was a lot of work. Now I&#39;m on the other side and reading the recs.

        So, I turned 55 today. Another year older. The changes? Well, I&#39;m seeing more doctors and seeing them more frequently and to be honest, I&#39;d love to have a day or two without some small niggling ache or pain but that&#39;s life. Like many people my age, we&#39;ve got our health issues but I&#39;m pretty active and managing mine (hey, I had a great 8 mile run this morning :-) ).

 As any reader here knows, Hunter was the first institution with state approved CS Teacher Education Masters and Certificate programs. Siena had the first Bachelors program (Hunter doesn&#39;t have undergraduate education programs that lead to state certification).

        I&#39;ve dedicated my entire career - something like 32 years, to CS education and the spread of CS education. So, while I try to be a cheerleader I also think it&#39;s important to call out things that we do or say that are maybe not so great.
 So, I hope I don&#39;t annoy too many people (or maybe I hope I do) with this post and maybe a few more to come.

        The other day, Natan scored tickets for us to see an interview with High Jackman and Sutton Foster. We&#39;ll be seeing them in &#34;The Music Man&#34; come this fall.
 It was fun but it was the taping for a radio interview so nothing earth shattering or surprising. Still, one thing stuck with me and got me thinking.
 Jackman told a story about how, during rehearsals, he wandered down from his dressing room to find Foster was working with Jerry Zaks, the director on &#34;My White Knight.

        Just finished entering grades closing out my 32nd year teaching.
 Whew!
 It&#39;s been a hard year for me and I&#39;m sure even harder for the K12 teachers out there. Still this year I&#39;m really missing what I was oh so many years ago - a regular teacher.
 Teaching from September through June is a beast and from my first day on the job I had to work ten times harder than I ever had to as a software engineer and was commensurately exhausted.
