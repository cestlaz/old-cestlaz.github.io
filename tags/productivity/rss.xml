      <title>Using Emacs 72 - Customizing Elfeed</title>

      <description>I made this video write after I made the openwith one so even though I don&amp;#39;t mention anything in this video, I wanted to share some updates on dired and openwith.  I got a lot of suggestions on alternate ways to achieve the workflow I was seeking - being able to open a file using an external viewer. One person noted that under newer versions of Emacs, the W key is bound to the command (browse-url-of-dired-file) which does exactly what I wanted.</description>

      <title>Using Emacs 71 Openwith</title>

      <description>I spend most of my time in Emacs but still use the shell and browser for some things. One of the things I use my shell for is to launch libreoffice to view and edit docx files and spreadsheets, evince for pdf files and imagemagick for image files. Yes, I know I can view all of these in Emacs but there are a few limitations:    Emacs chokes on large files    I can&amp;#39;t edit the docx file or the image    So, I hop to the shell and launch the program I need on the files in question.</description>

      <title>Using Emacs 70 Org Protocol</title>

      <description>I spent part of today cleaning up my Emacs workflow. Specifically, how I capture emails and links into org-mode  I already wrote about how I used org-capture (here and here). It&amp;#39;s pretty clean and easy but there was one thing that always nagged at me. When I capture from mu4e within Emacs by hitting C-c m it&amp;#39;s set up to automatically populate the capture template with a link to the email labelled with the email&amp;#39;s subject.</description>

      <description>Hunter, like most other schools has gone remote. I taught my first two online classes on Thursday. Currently, I&amp;#39;m using Zoom for synchronous stuff and a mailing list and slack for async.  There are still some missing pieces. When we&amp;#39;re all together, it&amp;#39;s easy to look at a student&amp;#39;s work and talk them through issues. It&amp;#39;s also easy to get students to work together, at least to a point.</description>

      <title>Using Emacs Episode 68 - Tramp and org-publish</title>

      <description>I maintain a couple of small simple web sites. One provides information about my undergraduate honors CS program and another that isn&amp;#39;t live yet is a FAQ for my CS teacher certification program.  Traditionally I would use ssh to connect to the host machine, fire up Emacs and edit the html files to update the sites. I always forget that with Emacs we can do better.  One way is with Tramp Mode.</description>

      <title>Using Emacs Episode 67 - Emacs vs Vi a rant with some historical perspective</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-67-emacs-rant/</link>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been meaning to do my version of the Emacs VI rant for a while. A few years ago I staged out a video showing what it would be like for a beginner to start with Emacs, Vim, Atom, and Sublime Text but decided it would be long, unwieldy and clunky to present - particularly when it came to customization.  I tabled it for a while but recently have been seeing a bunch of threads, videos and posts talking about Emacs and Vim.</description>

      <title>Using Emacs 66 - an eshell switcher in elisp</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-66-eshell-elisp/</link>

      <description>I thought it was time to give eshell in Emacs another try. It has some pretty cool features but for whatever reason, I&amp;#39;ve never really been able to adopt Emacs as my go to shell.  Eshell out of the box is pretty cool but could use some enhancements. When launching at login it doesn&amp;#39;t know about the path you set in your .bashrc or .zshrc in my case files.</description>

      <title>Using Emacs 65 - Live Python</title>

      <description>The other day I stumbled upon Emacs&amp;#39;s Live Coding plugin. It takes interactive coding up to the next level.  Normally, when you code Python, if you&amp;#39;re working in a REPL, every time you hit &amp;lt;Enter&amp;gt; the line you just typed is evaluated. When you&amp;#39;re working ina source file, you&amp;#39;re just editing until you send the file into a Python interpreter.  With this module, your file is continually evaluated as you type and it shows you the results in a side window.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been using the gmail web interface for a long time. My first email or at least the oldest one still in the system dates back to Oct 18, 2004 7:29am. It was a letter to a buddy about an indoor turkey fryer and if he needed a lift to Fairway the following morning to shop.  Before that, I used my Panix shell account - probably with PINE.</description>

      <title>Using Emacs 63 ClojureScript</title>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been playing with ClojureScipt for my web projects recently and really like it. Much more fun than any of the JavaScript frameworks I&amp;#39;ve used.  Still, getting started was somewhat difficult due to the number of options in tooling and uneven documentation and learning resources.  Here&amp;#39;s a video that shows how I use Emacs for ClojureScript development but the focus of the video is on how to get started with ClojureScript and Emacs takes a back seat other than an example of my workflow.</description>

      <title>Using Emacs 62 Magit Forge</title>

      <description>Ever since I started looking at Magit as a &amp;#34;git dashboard&amp;#34; instead of as a &amp;#34;git interface&amp;#34; it&amp;#39;s been yet another Emacs killer app to me. I just recently started playing with forge which allows Magit to interface and interact with git &amp;#34;forges&amp;#34; like GitHub. This allows you to work on issues and pull requests without ever leaving Emacs.  Here&amp;#39;s a video on how easy it is. The video doesn&amp;#39;t show this but the first time you fire forge up it will prompt you for credentials.</description>

      <description>By living in Emacs I get a consistent interface across all sorts of tasks - programming, lesson planning, making presentations, preparing documents, and yes, even email. I&amp;#39;ve been using mu4e as my Emacs email client for a while now. Currently, I&amp;#39;m using Emacs for my work email and Gmail for personal. I&amp;#39;ve been thinking of going whole hog to mu4e and possibly migrating from Gmail to a new email provider for the personal stuff but there are still a few pain points with Emacs email:    rich text emails (embedded links, images, etc)    calendar integration    contacts    periodic Maildir sync problems with mbsync    Calendar integration isn&amp;#39;t a make or break issue and contacts with mu4e is good enough so that leaves two pain points.</description>

      <description>I started to work on a web application the other day. It&amp;#39;s nothing special but if I ever finish it, it will be a pretty complete project. The backend will be a REST API and I&amp;#39;m planning on writing the frontend in Clojurescript.  The problem with developing a web application like this is that you can&amp;#39;t really write the front end until you have enough of the backend to provide data.</description>

      <description>Org-mode is my markup of choice. I spend the vast majority of my time working on text files working in org-mode. Since GitHUb started rendering org-mode files in their site I&amp;#39;ve also used org-mode for things like Readme files in my projects. I even force it on my students at times. When I make an assignment, I seed it with an org-mode file that they have to modify - that is - fill in things like their names, group members etc.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to check out lsp-mode under Emacs for a while now. LSP stands for Language Protocol Service. The idea is that you have a standard interface between your editor and some language server. If you program in multiple languages and each has an LSP server you end up, in theory, with a simpler configuration and a consistent interface.  This certainly sounds more appealing than how we did it in the old days where you have some ad hoc configuraiton for each language you work in.</description>

      <description>One of Emacs power features that I&amp;#39;ve never quite gotten into is dired, the Directory Editor. I&amp;#39;ve already done a video on the package. It&amp;#39;s really cool and I do use it at times but I still haven&amp;#39;t started using it for my day to day.  Well, I just started using a couple of packages that might change this. They&amp;#39;re part of a set of dired addons that you can check out at the dired hacks page.</description>

      <description>One of the great things about Emacs is that it&amp;#39;s not just for writing programs. Sure, you can set it up as an IDE for just about every programming language under the sun but that&amp;#39;s just the tip of the iceberg. I use Emacs for just about all my text processing. This includes writing blog posts, reading and writing emails, creating lesson plans and pretty much anything and everything having to do with text.</description>

      <description>Last year I put together a post and video on some basics of Emacs for C++ development. In the video I didn&amp;#39;t quite get completions fully working. I also used ggtags in that video but find myself using dumb-jump more frequently.  Here&amp;#39;s a quick video showing how to set up irony-mode which uses libclang for completions. It&amp;#39;s pretty slick. Now the only thing I think I&amp;#39;m missing is header file completions.</description>

      <description>As you know I use Emacs for all sorts of things. In addition to coding, I use it for email, my schedule, note taking, and much much more. As part of my job at Hunter, I read and evaluate some of the Macaulay Honors College applications. I also have to evaluate all the applicants to my CS honors program. I described how I use Org-mode and Emacs to help with that here.</description>

      <description>I use both org-mode and Google Calendar for scheduling. I like Google Calendar because:    It&amp;#39;s pretty universal so I can issue and accept calendar invites.    It works well with my phone and other mobile devices.    The rest of my family doesn&amp;#39;t live in Emacs :-(.    I prefer using org-mode beacuse:    Emacs    I prefer, for the most part, to control my data.</description>

      <description>I was originally going to do a video on how I set things up so that I get an email every morning with my org-mode agenda but that&amp;#39;s going to be something of an ordeal. I have to create a droploet on Digital Ocean, set up SyncThing and a mail server and lots of other things.  I&amp;#39;ll get to that video at some point but in the meantime I saw this thread on the Emacs subreddit.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;#39;t believe that I haven&amp;#39;t made a video since the beginning of summer!!!  Part of the reason is that I haven&amp;#39;t had any video ideas that have motivated me and the other reason is that the Fall is my busiest season.  In any event, here&amp;#39;s the latest installment.  Take a look at how I use Emacs and more specifically org-mode for my day to day work.</description>
