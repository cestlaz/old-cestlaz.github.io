        Since we ended up with an eight post postmortem on our CS Teaching Certificate summer intensive I thought I&#39;d add add an index page.  Here are links to each post:    Introduction - program overview    On pedagogy - CS teaching methods    Topics in Computer Science    Deciding on which methods to teach    Commentary on selected CS topics    Tools for remote instruction    Building a community of CS teachers    The good, the bad, and what&#39;s next    I also wrote a few posts as the summer intensive was running:    Week 1    Week 2    An unplugged activity    We start up again in a couple of weeks so look for more updates on the program then.

        Looking back, what worked and what didn&#39;t?  Overall, things went very well. We were extremely happy with the cohort&#39;s growth and performance and based on feedback received they were happy with the program so far. I&#39;ll also say that while they&#39;re not finished yet, I can honestly say that every one of them would be a boon to any school in the city in need of a CS teacher (but they&#39;re not available since they&#39;re all already teaching CS at their respective schools :-)).

        What so many non-teachers just don&#39;t get is culture and community can be so much more powerful than curriculum. The problem is, culture and community are harder to create, curate, and maintain and the results don&#39;t always show up on standardized tests.  You can&#39;t force community or culture in a classroom but you can try your best to foster it. It&#39;s ultimately up to the class as a whole.

        I&#39;ve frequently been asked for curricula. I&#39;ll hear from a school or someone otherwise involved in a school or education and they&#39;ll ask for a course they can drop in and teach.  I explain it doesn&#39;t work that way. A syllabus or curriculum is only so good. A great curriculum with a bad teacher will still be bad but a great teacher can do a lot to salvage a horrible curriculum.

        Officially, the last course of the summer was &#34;Modern Topics in Computer Science.&#34; The idea was that K12 CS teachers on the one hand need depth beyond the typical terminal high school course, hence data structures and also breadth so that they could create electives, mix teasers in to the regular courses, or help precocious students with independent or semi-independant explorations.  If someone was teaching this in a typical fall or spring semester course, they&#39;d probably have a list of topics and spend a couple of weeks on each.

        Now that the summer portion of Hunter College&#39;s Advanced Certificate in Teaching Computer Science is over I thought I&#39;d do a postmortem. That is, a few posts about what we did and how it all went.  First, though, an overview of the program.  The Advanced Certificate program is geared towards teachers who are currently certified in another subject area who wish to earn an additional New York State teaching certificate in Computer Science.

        When we first went remote I jumped on Zoom. I already new the technology and it most simulated a live class. Basically, it was the best combination if quick, easy, and effective and we were under the gun to get something going and give our students some sense of normalcy and continuity.  As we settled in though, it made sense to try some different things. One was the &#34;lab packet.

        I was reading Mary Clair Wright&#39;s new blog the other day. It&#39;s always great to see another teacher sharing publicly online.  One line caught my eye in her latest post -  &lt;blockquote&gt; Remote instruction is weird, I can’t see them. I have to trust that they will message me with questions. &lt;/blockquote&gt;  This is a real problem. It&#39;s hard enough in a regular class where we can pick up an all sorts of cues and use all sorts formal and informal assessments but when the students are on the other end of a teleconference or even more challenging an email or chat it&#39;s even harder.

        While tools like Zoom, Slack and others are a tremendous boon as we&#39;re forced to do all our teaching remotely the limitations become apparent as we settle in and try to go beyond the basics of an offsite meeting.  Today was code review day in my CS1 class. It&#39;s a lesson that I enjoy teaching and I think my students get a lot out of it. Today we had to do it remote.
