        I&#39;ve been teaching in person for about a month now so I thought I&#39;d give a quick update on how it&#39;s going. I&#39;ve written before about my feelings on how Hunter started the semester (TL;DR - I was very displeased) but that&#39;s not the point of this post. As of today, I believe every student has been required to be stabbed at least once and on October 11, all students must be fully vaccinated to be on campus.

        Back to calling an audible.
 Around seven years ago I was visiting with some former students at Google in Mountain View. One of them from way back in the late 90s, Pawel, out of the blue said there was one lesson I taught that was particularly memorable. Not memorable in the &#34;that was fun&#34; way like maybe my Halloween adventures but memorable in that he felt he got a lot more out of it than a normal lesson.

        This post by my friend Alfred caught my eye yesterday. It&#39;s a good post - some good examples of inserting student creativity even into small intro level assignments. While I like the post and agree with the sentiment of open ended, student driven projects, I had to take issue with the lead quote Alfred used:  “If you assign a project and get back 30 of the same thing, that’s not a project, that is a recipe.

        Be ready to call an audible.
 This was advice I got during my third year teaching. I had just transferred from Seward Park to Stuy and was being observed for the first time by my former teacher and now supervisor Richie Rothenberg. I forget exactly what the lesson was on - something with coordinate geometry I think. The lesson was okay but it wasn&#39;t going over well with the class.

        Yesterday was my first day of in person teaching since early March 2020. It was,… interesting.
 I was looking forward to actually seeing my students in person but as I mentioned in my last post, i wasn&#39;t comfortable given Hunter&#39;s current COVID policy and Delta.
 I&#39;ll be happier come mid October when 100% of students on campus will be vaccinated but at least for now, mask compliance is high.

        I&#39;ve written about how long it takes to become a master teacher and that even after 9 or 10 years most teachers are really just advanced beginners. A big reason for that is our long feedback loop. You do something and you can&#39;t do it again for a year.
 I was listening to a podcast on my morning run by the Hudson River and something came up about differences between quantities of items.

 They went on about how they get to create cool problems which makes it so much easier to teach than other subjects.
 I&#39;ve heard this a lot over the years particularly from teachers who are into gaming - &#34;CS is fun because you can create games.

Not sure who needs to hear this, but stop taking off points for late assignments. It’s not helping students learn responsibility, and it’s not making your job easier. It’s only making your class inequitable. 💯
&mdash; Sydney Jensen (@sydneycjensen) September 26, 2020   I disagreed. I wasn&#39;t necessarily against floating or open deadlines without deductions but rather, they made my life more difficult and weren&#39;t in the best interest of my students.
