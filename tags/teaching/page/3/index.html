        We used Zoom for remote classes over the summer but at this point, I&#39;ve also used Coding Rooms, Big Blue Button, and Google meet as well. They each have their own strong points and failings but all are limited in terms of sharing multiple cameras and screen components. All will let you share your camera or share your screen and when you share you screen you can either share it all or a single window.

        Thursday was the first day of the new semester. The big change was that my classes were done remotely but there were also some other differences. Other changes were that I only met one of my two CS classes on Thursday. That&#39;s my CS0. I&#39;m also teaching a recitation for CS1 which only meets once a week. I&#39;ll see those students as well as my CS0 students for a second time on Monday.

        Looking back, what worked and what didn&#39;t?
Overall, things went very well. We were extremely happy with the cohort&#39;s growth and performance and based on feedback received they were happy with the program so far. I&#39;ll also say that while they&#39;re not finished yet, I can honestly say that every one of them would be a boon to any school in the city in need of a CS teacher (but they&#39;re not available since they&#39;re all already teaching CS at their respective schools :-)).

        What so many non-teachers just don&#39;t get is culture and community can be so much more powerful than curriculum. The problem is, culture and community are harder to create, curate, and maintain and the results don&#39;t always show up on standardized tests.
You can&#39;t force community or culture in a classroom but you can try your best to foster it. It&#39;s ultimately up to the class as a whole. It&#39;s like I tell groups who come to events I organize.

        I&#39;ve frequently been asked for curricula. I&#39;ll hear from a school or someone otherwise involved in a school or education and they&#39;ll ask for a course they can drop in and teach.
I explain it doesn&#39;t work that way. A syllabus or curriculum is only so good. A great curriculum with a bad teacher will still be bad but a great teacher can do a lot to salvage a horrible curriculum.

        Officially, the last course of the summer was &#34;Modern Topics in Computer Science.&#34; The idea was that K12 CS teachers on the one hand need depth beyond the typical terminal high school course, hence data structures and also breadth so that they could create electives, mix teasers in to the regular courses, or help precocious students with independent or semi-independant explorations. If someone was teaching this in a typical fall or spring semester course, they&#39;d probably have a list of topics and spend a couple of weeks on each.

The Advanced Certificate program is geared towards teachers who are currently certified in another subject area who wish to earn an additional New York State teaching certificate in Computer Science.

        When we first went remote I jumped on Zoom. I already new the technology and it most simulated a live class. Basically, it was the best combination if quick, easy, and effective and we were under the gun to get something going and give our students some sense of normalcy and continuity.
As we settled in though, it made sense to try some different things. One was the &#34;lab packet.
