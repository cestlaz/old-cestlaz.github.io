    <div class="content post-summary">
        I just read Jeff Yearout&#39;s recent post titled The Beginner&#39;s Garden of Concepts. Not directly related but it got me thinking about programming idioms.
 I&#39;ve been using the phrase &#34;programming idiom&#34; for years to describe a short useful recurring code construct. I didn&#39;t realize that it was officially &#34;a thing&#34; until doing a web search on the phrase years later.
 As our students grow from newbies on I think it&#39;s helpful for them to see recurring and related patterns and programming idioms gives us a name to apply to many beginner patterns.

    </header>

    <div class="content post-summary">
        Last year I wrote about repl.it, an online IDE that supports multiple languages. At the time it had some rudimentary classroom support and since I started using it, repl.it has become better and better. I used it last year with my class because I had to start the year in a lab where I couldn&#39;t easily install my own software. I&#39;ll continue to use repl.it - mostly for it&#39;s ability to schedule publish and manage assignments but when possible, I like having my students work locally.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        With the school year starting I was originally planning on writing about my class rules.
 Instead I think I&#39;ll riff on Alfred Thompson&#39;s post today titled Curriculum is Hard. I&#39;m guessing I found curriculum design and development daunting decades ago but at this point in my career it&#39;s something I enjoy. In any event, Alfred got me to thinking - when is a curriculum your own?
 If you grab a curriculum complete with lesson plans, assignments; the whole kit and caboodle and you use it verbatim it&#39;s clearly not your curriculum.

        I got an email from a friend the other day. Among other things, he mentioned that he would be teaching APCS-A for the first time this year. He&#39;s a little trepidatious. He knows his stuff but he hasn&#39;t really done much using Java.
 I was going to respond in an email but thought I might share here instead.
 TL;DR - for all you APCS teachers who are new or new to Java - learn your core CS, lean on your resources and support and it&#39;s OK to tell your kids &#34;I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ll get back to you.

        Brenda Wilkerson, Director of CS and IT education for Chicago public schools was one of the keynote speakers at this year&#39;s CSTA conference. During her talk, she made a comment about it taking three times through to get it right so if you&#39;re working hard and struggling in your first year of teaching CS, it&#39;s not the time to give up. Learning to teach takes time.
 She&#39;s absolutely correct.

        Is it easier to take CS people and teach them to teach or is it easier to take teachers and teach them CS?
 The question gets batted around from time to time.
 This time via twitter:
Some think it&#39;s easier to teach a teacher to teach CS than to teach a CS pro to teach. @alfredtwo is not one of them https://t.co/QCUP8d8llZ

 The post was asking for any links to &#34;the literature.&#34; I can&#39;t speak to that but I I&#39;ve done something similar to what the post was asking about so, as per usual, I thought I&#39;d write about it here.

 For the Fall semester, I taught an intro programming course to the entire cohort. For some in the cohort, this was their first exposure to CS.
