        AP scores just came out. As usual, I see the posts and take part in conversations where teachers talk about their results. Some are happy about their results, some aren&#39;t, some don&#39;t really care.
 I just want to make a plea to all AP teachers out there:
 Don&#39;t let your value be dictated by the college board or any other exam.
 I never really cared much about my students&#39; actual AP scores.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        As a high school teacher, I was never able to attend SIGCSE, the conference of the ACM&#39;s Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education. Between the number of instructional days I would lose and the cost, I could never justify going. Instead I looked over the proceedings and read many of the papers.
 Now that I&#39;m at Hunter, I was finally able to attend. This year in Seattle, the conference ran from Wednesday through Saturday.

        div.center {text-align:center;}   Just completed the second time through for my Software Development course. Last year we had a great time at our Demo Night hosted at Google.  This year, unfortunately, due to a variety of reasons, we couldn't get the event together. Still, the kids did great work so I thought I'd share.  This year, I asked each group to make a short video.  First up, we've got bit&lt;&lt;shift - a search engine for code.

 and why my students are going to hate me tomorrow.
 When my good friend Gerry Seidman talks to my classes, he frequently says &ldquo;never use a data structure or algorithm you couldn&rsquo;t build yourself.&rdquo;
This doesn&rsquo;t mean that you have to write everything from scratch, just that you should have some knowledge as to what&rsquo;s going on under the hood. I find that all too often young programmers just rely on APIs and libraries and really don&rsquo;t know how their computers and programs are working.

        On going back to work today Since school was still out due to Sandy, we ran a second online class yesterday. At the end of the session, which I&rsquo;ll summarize below, I told the class what I wanted them to accomplish today and over the weekend. One student queried &ldquo;you mean no class on Friday :-(?&rdquo; Alas no &ndash; while students aren&rsquo;t reporting to school this morning, teachers are.
Of course the logic as to why is far from sound.

        Here's what the bridge leading across the West Side Highway over to Stuy during the storm. Hence the title with the weak tech reference.  The storm has kept the schools closed all week so it's as good a time as any to try to resurrect this blog.  As you can see, I've moved from blogger to a Jekyll based blog hosted on Github. I'm really liking the way it works but more on that at a later date.

        Anyone can cook - Chef Gusteau
These days the rage seems anyone can code.
On line attempts to teach coding and computing abound.
We've got Udacity and Coursera trying to bring college level academic offerings to the masses on one extreme and more down to earth "learn to code" efforts with Codecademy getting the most press.
While I applaud any effort to make knowledge more accessible, there are a lot of unanswered questions as to the effectiveness of these latest attempts.

        A couple of weeks ago, I attended the K-12 workshop at the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing Conference. It was great to reconnect with some old friends, make some new ones, and talk shop for the weekend.
One result was that I promised to start blogging again.
I've got a number of ideas for posts lined up. Some on pedagogy, some technical, and some cultural. Hope you enjoy them.

In thinking about how I frequently programs, once I have a plan, I work on one part of the project, and then ask myself "what's next?" That is, what is the next step towards completion.
It reminded me about a guest speaker we had a about a year and a half ago at one of our "professional development" days. For the past two years, our school has had "
