I know I said that I was done with chatGPT but since I&amp;#39;ve ended up
sharing my posts with a few people I though a quick table of contents
post would be appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post 1 - &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/cheating&#34;&gt;Some general thoughts on cheating&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post 2 - &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/cheatgpt/&#34;&gt;Cheating with chatGPT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post 3 - &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teachgpt/&#34;&gt;Teaching with chatGPT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post 4 - &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/chatgpt-good-bad-ugly/&#34;&gt;More teaching with chatGPT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Teaching with chatGPT - The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/chatgpt-good-bad-ugly/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2023 11:03:52 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/chatgpt-good-bad-ugly/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The plan was to talk about what we can and should do in CS classes
with respect to chatGPT type technologies but after seeing so much
discussion on how to and not to use chatGPT I thought I&amp;#39;d insert this
additional post on classroom use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We already talked about &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/po%60st/teachgpt/&#34;&gt;the good&lt;/a&gt;. I love the idea of making an essay
with errors for proof reading and it can be a great search resource,
albeit one that needs to be error checked and I&amp;#39;m sure many other
productive teaching and teaching support applications will turn up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We also talked about &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/cheatgpt/&#34;&gt;the bad&lt;/a&gt;. The big one being potential cheating -
crossing the line from research or understanding aid to using it as an
inappropriate shortcut. It also just plain out fails at times to do
what you wnat it to do but that&amp;#39;s really reasonable given what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about the ugly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ugly is probably the wrong word. I&amp;#39;m talking about using chatGPT or
any technology because it&amp;#39;s new and cool and not because it&amp;#39;s actually
the right tool in the right place at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is nothing new and not restricted to education. Years ago, my
parent&amp;#39;s taxes were audited. The auditor has one of those new fangled
electronic calculators and he was so enthralled  with it that he kept
showing it off and all it could to do my parents throughout the
audit. My parents were pretty sharp overall and my dad was very good
with numbers. At the end of the day the auditor determined that my
parents didn&amp;#39;t owe taxes but actually were due a sizable refund. When
all was said and done, my dad pointed out all the times that the
auditor messed up with the calculator which resulted in the
refund. The truth was that the taxes were filed correctly to begin
with but my folks weren&amp;#39;t going to turn away free money. The auditor
should have just gone old school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve seen some examples already of &amp;#34;the ugly&amp;#34; and I&amp;#39;m sure there will be
more to come. Also, I want to emphasize that &amp;#34;the ugly&amp;#34; doesn&amp;#39;t
necessarily mean bad,  I just wanted to use that turn of phrase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A friend of mine suggested using chatGPT to evaluate  essays for when
students aren&amp;#39;t comfortable with other people viewing their
work. Assuming that we&amp;#39;re confident that chatGPT will do a good job
this could work but I&amp;#39;d have some concerns. True, this could alleviate
a student&amp;#39;s fear of peer grading but building a supportive community
of peers that &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; support you is important and I&amp;#39;m leery of using
technology too much as a crutch. Also that while this might offload
work from the teacher, it also removes an opportunity for the teacher
to build more of a relationship with the student through the
interaction and through their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m not enough of an expert on language/english classes to really
judget that bt here&amp;#39;s a similar CS related example that I saw
suggested online. Have students enter programs in into chatGPT and ask
the system to add comments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I tried this with a couple of small intro type programs and each time
I got the same style of comments. Things like a comment on top of a
loop saying &amp;#34;loop from 1 to n&amp;#34; or on top of a line like &lt;code&gt;sum = 0&lt;/code&gt;
saying &amp;#34;initialize the sum  to 0.&amp;#34; Not good comments at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This, I&amp;#39;d describe as ugly. If chatGPT consistently gives these types
of comments then it&amp;#39;s pretty worthless as an activity if the goal is
to help students understand commenting and writing good code. On the
other hand, if chatGPT sometimes gives these ridiculous comments and
at other times gives good comments, well, that&amp;#39;s pretty bad as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, if it always gives bad answers it could be a fun activity. Solve
the problem in class, have chatGPT comment it, and then you can
discuss good and bad coding styles and the limits of programs like
chatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Generating lessons plans also counts to me as ugly, unless you use it
to add standards to your plans to fulfill requirements from
above. Yeah, it&amp;#39;s cool that this program can make a bare bones bullet
point lesson but you then have to read it, evaluate it, check it for
errors and then still add all the meat to the bones and customize it
for your students. I&amp;#39;d argue that if a teacher knows their stuff it&amp;#39;ll
slow them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Normally, when using a new technology an educator should ask
themselves if it saves time and/or effort and does it improve
instruction/learning and make sure that there&amp;#39;s some real benefit to
the use. It&amp;#39;s fine if that benefit comes later and requires some dues
to be paid now but if it&amp;#39;s just a cool new technology, the new shiny
if you would, I&amp;#39;ll pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a final note, even when the ugly doesn&amp;#39;t save time or improve
instruction it&amp;#39;s not necessarily bad. A good teacher knows when a
class needs a break and also when they themselves need one. It&amp;#39;s fine
to burn some time on a fun but not productive activity either for
mental health, community building or other positive reasons. It&amp;#39;s not
healthy to be 100% on task 100% of the time and a good teacher gets
this. What&amp;#39;s important to also understand is when a new technology or
tool can be used productively and when it&amp;#39;s just a diversion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CheatGPT</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/cheatgpt/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 06:42:45 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/cheatgpt/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Just got back from a few much needed days away so it&amp;#39;s time to get to
those chatGPT posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Last time, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/cheating/&#34;&gt;I wrote on&lt;/a&gt; cheating in general. That seems to be one of the
hot points for chatGPT, in fact, the NYC DOE just last week decided to
ban chatGPT outright, presumably for that reason. We&amp;#39;ll talk about the
student side, both negative and postitive today and the teacher side
next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To start, while on vacation I saw this tweet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Any educator who is saying “ChatGPT won’t affect MY classroom” better get humble really quickly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a friend said, “This is like when my AP called me into his office &amp;amp; asked ‘Have you seen this thing called Google?’”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s going to change the way we think about writing forever.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Chris Lehmann (@chrislehmann) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/chrislehmann/status/1611777320745828360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;January 7, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sure, it&amp;#39;s going to change our classrooms but it&amp;#39;s not like this is
the first time. We went from nothing to calculators to graphing
calculators to programs like Wolfram Alpha. I&amp;#39;ve been telling my
students for decades that Emacs Calc mode could not only solve all
their math assignments symbolically but it could also typeset them
directly in TeX so their homeworks would look professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the non-math side we&amp;#39;ve added word processors to spell checkers to
grammar aides not to mention collaborative environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And we haven&amp;#39;t even mentioned search engines, wikipedia, youtube and
the scores of other resources available today that didn&amp;#39;t exist years
ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
New technologies come in to play over and over again and teachers
adapt. Unfortunately, instead of giving teachers the resources they
need to adapt efficiently, districts normally opt for a hammer and
then blame teachers regardless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, now we have a new tool - will students use it to cheat? Sure -
some will but this is nothing new.  I&amp;#39;d like to believe that the
majority of students will use the new tool productively but to do so,
many will need guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Should the NYC DOE have banned chatGPT? I&amp;#39;d say no. Well, actually,
I&amp;#39;d say yes but with a caveat and we&amp;#39;ll get to that below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been playing with chatGPT a bit now and it certainly seems to be
able to generate student quality essays on a variety of topics. It
100% can solve introductory CS programming problems, frequently just
by pasting the teachers prompt in the chat box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This can, of course, lead to cheating but shutting down the technology
in school won&amp;#39;t change a thing. As usual, draconian measures will do
little to deter bad behavior and will merely make things more
difficult for kids who want to do things the right way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let me use GitHub as an example. I&amp;#39;ve had &lt;strong&gt;many&lt;/strong&gt; professors tell me
that they&amp;#39;ll have students use GitHub but &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; if repos are private
so as to prevent cheating. Right - making a repo private is really
going to prevent some kid from sharing their code. Sure, it&amp;#39;ll prevent
a random student from stumbling on their work but it&amp;#39;s going to do
nothing to prevent a bad actor from acting badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the same time, it sows distrust and prevents students who want to
productively share and help each other (with proper attribution) from
doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Banning a tool in school only serves to limit students who want to do
things the right way anyway. Cheating happened prior to chatGPT and
prior to older technologies. Some students have always cut corners
either by crossing the line with friends or even paying for essays
online. Now with chatGPT, I can type in &amp;#34;write a program to do…&amp;#34;
rather than search StackOverflow or ask a friend or pay a service but
it doesn&amp;#39;t change the fact that no matter what, some students will
cheat. On the other hand, if you cultivate a classroom where support
and sharing is encouraged, don&amp;#39;t overwork students, provide the needed
resources and allow for failure and growth, you&amp;#39;ll minimize the
problems. Of course I just described a panacea that can rarely be
created in a public school given large class sizes, emphasis on
standardized testing, and all the baggage dumped on teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In a programming class, a solution could be to allow chatGPT but to
include lab time in the class. During that time, the teacher can
observe students and really get to know what they know - their
strengths and weaknesses. I always was able to include lab time at
Stuy and before that at Seward Park and by the end of the term, I knew
my students, what they could do, and where they had challenges. To be
honest, I could assign letter grades from that info alone and the
grades would pretty much match the test results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This can be done but it&amp;#39;s getting more and more challenging given the
weight placed upon teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Given this, in my class, I don&amp;#39;t want to ban chatGPT but want to
take the time to figure out how to use it productively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why then did I say earlier that districts &lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt; ban it? Because at
the end of the day, schools and teachers should set these policies but
these policies need to be supported by the district. The district has
to have the principal&amp;#39;s back and the principal, their teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A district should say &amp;#34;here&amp;#39;s the boilerplate policy to ban chatGPT so
if in your school or class it&amp;#39;s inappropriate, you can ban it and we&amp;#39;ve
got your back. On the other hand, a principle can implement a looser
policy and that&amp;#39;s fine and we encourage schools to implement policies
where chatGPT can be used effectively as a learning tool&amp;#34; and then
provide some boilerplate language for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The district has to have the hardest line because in some cases, that
hard line will be either appropriate or necessary and then schools can
loosen the restrictions as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, that&amp;#39;s my take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next time - chatGPT as a teacher aide.&lt;/p&gt;
