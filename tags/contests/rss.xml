      <description>I&amp;#39;m now well behind in Advent of Code. Traveling up to Michigan to see my son and my brother and his family will do that.

The thread is about the level of difficulty of the various problems and Eric&amp;#39;s comment talks about some of the factors that go into creating a good collection of problems for a contest and the difficulties involved.</description>
