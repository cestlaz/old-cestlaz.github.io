    </header>

    <div class="content post-summary">
        Yesterday, I ranted on about the College Board. This led to a Facebook hosted discussion which got me thinking a little more:
 Advanced Placement exams basically exist because we don&#39;t trust our high school teachers.
 I usually use phrases like &#34;society doesn&#39;t trust&#34; but let&#39;s personalize it this time â€“ for parents, think about whether or not you trust your kids teachers? Do you a large private, unaccountable organization more?

        Edit:   Just a brief note to clarify a couple of things. As indicated in the comments, this post isn&#39;t about what&#39;s appropriate for HS CS. It&#39;s more about what kids have after they finish their education - be it high school, college, code school, or other.
 Some of my thoughts are the results of pondering on the exacerbations of friends after interviewing people for entry level positions.

    </header>

    <div class="content post-summary">
        The difficulties I&#39;ve had with the city and DOE are pretty well documented by now.
 Today I&#39;m going to tell you about my latest dealings with DOE and how they prevented my team from bringing free quality CS education to city students.
 CSTUY&#39;s not running SHIP, its summer program this year.
 That&#39;s not something I&#39;m happy about but part of me knew it might happen. What did surprise me, although it shouldn&#39;t have, was the role that the NYC DOE played in preventing it from happening.

        There are all sorts of awards for teachers. The Presidential awards, NEA awards, National and State level awards, and more. There are also awards and honors given in more narrow areas like NCTM for math and our own ACM.
 I&#39;ve haven&#39;t won any and never expected to. I&#39;ve never played well with the establishment.
 It&#39;s ok though. For every honoree that I can point to and say &#34;there&#39;s a master teacher,&#34; there are half a dozen who you look at just know that it was more about politics and connections than about teaching chops.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        A few weeks ago, a friend asked if I knew any CS teachers that were available to work this summer. At the time, I didn&#39;t have anyone to recommend. We were still up in the air on running CSTUY&#39;s SHIP summer immersion program.
 We ultimately decided not to run SHIP this summer. Mostly due to the fact that in my new position, I didn&#39;t have the time to do the necessary fund-raising and outreach.

Of course, everyone whooping it up now was quick to say "all those rankings are meaningless"

        The StuyCS Family mailing list was host to an interesting discussion today. One of our younger members asked if the practice of giving technical problems during an interview was going to follow him throughout his career or if it goes away for more senior applicants.  An interesting discussion followed.  It reminded me of a time I was talking to a few senior engineers at a large tech company.

        div.center {text-align:center;}    Today was a "professional development day." That means that instead of teaching, we were supposed to work on our craft.  Rather than the normal nonsense - forcing CS teachers to sit through common core math lectures or how to use the latest calculator, our host principal, Randy Asher, of Brooklyn Tech let us do our thing.  Basically, it was a bunch of CS teachers from two schools - Stuy and Brooklyn Tech, talking shop for most of the day.
