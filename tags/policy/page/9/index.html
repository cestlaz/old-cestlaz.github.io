    </header>

    <div class="content post-summary">
        Some buzz seems to have circulated on the data compiled by Barbara Ericson on AP Computer Science test takers in 2013. In addition to going to the source there was a piece in The Atlantic and in Education Week.
Some exciting results:
In two states just as many girls passed the AP CS exam as guys!!!!! In two other states, just 6 more guys passed than girls!!!!! In yet another state, 100% of the girls passed, doing far better than the approximately 75% of the boys that passed!

Brandon and Ilana (also awesome but I haven't known her as long) are at HuffPost labs and also are working on important initiatives like Hacker Union.

        Earlier I wrote about the new teacher evaluation system and why a teacher such as myself might now be considered ineffective and two ineffectives in a row can cost you your job.
Well, the New York City and New York State Departments of Education are the departments that just keep on giving. Here&rsquo;s the latest.
This coming Wednesday, I won&rsquo;t be teaching during my usual 8:00 to 10:15 block of three AP classes.

        Each month, The Stuyvesant school paper - the Spectator invites a teacher to write a piece on, well, basically, whatever they want to. I did it this past month.
Here&rsquo;s a reposting of the piece. The original can be found on the Spectator site.
Enjoy
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got 10 periods of class and no lunch.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got four APs.&rdquo; &ldquo;Can I also take Great Books, Multivariate, Physics C, and Software Development?&rdquo; The goal of a Stuyvesant student: take as many electives and AP classes as possible.

        So here we are starting the new year and NY City is rolling out its new teacher evaluation system.
It was all over the news last year.
Ultimately, the state imposed the plan.
The city hailed the new plan as a way to fire under-performing teachers.
The UFT president hailed the plan as something that &ldquo;is designed to help teachers improve their skills&hellip;.&rdquo;
My take? All three parties have thrown the students and teachers under the bus.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        Over the last few years, I&rsquo;ve heard a lot of people talk about curriculum.
&ldquo;We need a curriculum that works for everyone.&rdquo;
&ldquo;If we had a good curriculum, we could get CS in the schools.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you just take someone else&rsquo;s curriculum and scale things out?&rdquo;
People miss the point. In my twenty some odd years as an educator and my forty five as a human (including 18 as a parent), I&rsquo;ve never heard someone talk about that one inspirational curriculum that made all the difference in their lives.

        People keep asking me about how we&rsquo;re doing with respect to gender balance and CS education at Stuy.
Rather than writing the same email again and again, I figured I&rsquo;d summarize things here.
We&rsquo;ve done rather well at Stuy. I might write more in depth at some point in the future but we don&rsquo;t dumb anything down and we aren&rsquo;t patronizing. I think much of the success can be attributed to:

        The Problem: The buzz word is &ldquo;accountability.&rdquo; Why are teachers special? Why don&rsquo;t they feel they need to be evaluated like other professionals? Why do they feel they need a &ldquo;job for life?&rdquo;
Of course, the job for life line is nonsense &ndash; teachers have tenure, but that&rsquo;s just due process - not a guarantee of a job.
Friends in the private sector ask &ldquo;if a teacher is doing a good job, why do they need tenure?

        Today I had the privilege of attending my second live State of the City address. Mayor Bloomberg didn&rsquo;t spend as much time on education as he did at last year&rsquo;s address but he did take a moment to give a shout out to charter schools. It gets old hearing the same false story about how charters are better than public schools. At least we have people like Gary Rubinstein and Diane Ravitch trying to set the record straight.
