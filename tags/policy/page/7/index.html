    <div class="content post-summary">
        div.center {text-align:center;}   The other day codehs made an announcement about their new autograder. Fellow CS Teaching veteran Alfred Thompson had his say up on his blog where he talked about Mark Guzdial's comment on autograders leading to less creative assignments.  I very much agree that autograders, due to their rigidness lend themselves to less creative projects, but thought I'd write up a few of my own thoughts on autograders.

        I won't be teaching my regular classes tomorrow. I'll be meeting all my kids but classes will only be 12 minutes long.  So, how will my colleagues and I spend the rest of the day?  Proctoring the PSAT.  This has always been a sore point with me. Back in the day, many schools, Stuy included, offered the PSAT on the weekend. If you wanted to proctor, you'd come in and get paid a little extra.

    </header>

    <div class="content post-summary">
        div.center {text-align:center;}    Earlier this week, Mayor Bill deBlasio announced some ambitious CS Education Plans for NYC. I posted a response here. Now that a few days past, I thought I'd clear a few things up.  First and foremost, I hope my concerns are unfounded and I hope the plan is a tremendous success.  What's got me bummed is not that I need to see my name in lights given that in many ways I've been a CS Ed trailblazer (although who doesn't like a little ego stroking), rather that in my humble opinion NY has squandered a great opportunity and resource and as a results, kids won't get nearly all they could.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        div.center {text-align:center;}   The NY Times just posted an article - the mayor announced a 10 year deadline by which time all NYC public school students will be taking CS.  I should be happy.  I'm not.  I feel thoroughly defeated.  As many of you know, I've struggled for years to try to bring CS education to more kids and to train more teachers. You also probably know that over the years, I've become pretty good at this.

        div.center text-align:center;    This post is in response to an email thread on the NYTM mailing list.

I've been at the CS Ed game for a long time.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        div.center {text-align:center;}    We talked about setting kids up to fail in math. What about CS?  Well, it's a little subtler.  I started thinking about this after a conversation with one of my graduates about Harvard's famous CS50. Since that conversation, I've spoken to a number of my kids that have gone through CS50 and most seem to say the same things: They don't really teach anything  The kids rely on a group member who already knows stuff or will learn all the stuff on their own  If it weren't for my StuyCS background my group would have really struggled.

        div.center {text-align:center;}   "Four in ten NYC high schools don't offer Algebra 2 and both Physics and Chemistry."  At least that's what this article and linked report say.  The implication is clear - many of our students don't have the opportunity to advance in math and the sciences.  The truth though is much more disturbing.  The reason why these schools aren't offering Algebra 2 is very simple - the kids aren't ready for it.

        This image has been making its rounds.  Largest expansion is pretty clear but are the largest gain in 3+ scores mean a higher percentage of 3+ scores or merely the result of more test takers?  I'm curious, but that's not what I wanted to talk about.  Looking at our AP results from this year we had:   For the past two years we've been allowed to run 7 sections of AP Computer Science with about 30 kids per class.
