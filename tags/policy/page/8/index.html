        div.center {text-align:center;}   The other day, Fred Wilson sent out a short tweet storm turned post on determining if an entrepreneur's startup idea is a good one. It's short. Take a minute to read it over.  At its core, the post and the comments talk about belief in an idea and it got me thinking about some things as an educator.  Tweet 7:   and you have to believe in yourself and your idea or nobody else ever will   resonated with me, not just in terms of a startup idea, but with respect to one's passion.

        div.center {text-align:center;}   In a recent post, Alfred Thompson referred to an earlier post where he mentioned rock star CS teachers. That's a term I've heard thrown around a lot in the past few years. I've heard some of my graduates referred to as rock stars - top tech people, and in fact I've seen some of them courted for positions in a manner that a rock star might be accustomed to.

The article talks about the drop in popularity of the old Advanced Placement AB course and its eventually being dropped as well as thoughts on how the current A course is pretty dry.

I think the fact that my buddy was questioning it is a major strike against CC.

        Last time, I shared my thoughts on the recent coverage of AP CS statistics. Compiled and presented by Barbara Ericson and later reported on all over the place.
To summarize my point of view - yes there is a problem but some of the highlighted data points can easily be shown to be irrelevant and therefore can hurt the greater goal of access to great CS education for all.
This felt like the launching pad for a great class discussion.

        Some buzz seems to have circulated on the data compiled by Barbara Ericson on AP Computer Science test takers in 2013. In addition to going to the source there was a piece in The Atlantic and in Education Week.
Some exciting results:
 In two states just as many girls passed the AP CS exam as guys!!!!! In two other states, just 6 more guys passed than girls!!!!! In yet another state, 100% of the girls passed, doing far better than the approximately 75% of the boys that passed!
