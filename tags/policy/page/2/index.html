        The big push at last year&#39;s CSTA conference was the release of the new CSTA K12 standards. It seemed that every other session was pushing them in one way or another. I&#39;ve been meaning to share my thoughts about them or, more specifically, learning standards in general for a while but with announcement about federal funding for CS coming from the White House last week I thought it was time.

TL;DR (although it really isn&#39;t too long so you should read it) - it&#39;s on Laurene Powell Jobs, her efforts to &#34;reform&#34; education and why she&#39;s misguided as are most of the well to do non-educators working hard to change and in many cases privatize public education.
Laura posts a nice list of simple, common sense ways to improve education.

        Now that I&#39;m back from vacation and summer&#39;s winding down I thought I&#39;d start getting back to more classroom related posts. I still have a few summer topics I want to write about â€“ standards and side projects in particular but I&#39;m also looking forward to talking more about the classroom since, after all, at my core, I&#39;m a teacher. When I saw this article in my inbox this morning I thought I&#39;d talk about it.

        Yesterday Mark Guzdial blogged about a NY Times piece discussing Silicon Valleys influence on education through Code.org.
Mark questioned the validity of the piece. If you don&#39;t read Mark&#39;s blog and you&#39;re in CS Ed you probably should.
I tried to leave a comment on Mark&#39;s blog - not about the NY Times article but rather my thoughts on why I think it&#39;s important that we remain wary and vigilant to industry and outsiders influence and impact on CS education and on education in general.

        For anyone involved in K12 CS education, the past few years have been a wild ride. When I first tried to make inroads in the DOE decades ago I couldn&#39;t get through the door. Now, CS Education is everyone&#39;s darling. It&#39;s really amazing. It&#39;s been a combination of grass roots efforts by teachers, non profit education efforts such as TEALS, advocacy of groups like Code.org and amazing individuals like Fred Wilson who has probably done more to move the needle of CS Ed in NY than any other 10 people combined.

This time via twitter:
Some think it&#39;s easier to teach a teacher to teach CS than to teach a CS pro to teach. @alfredtwo is not one of them https://t.co/QCUP8d8llZ

        Back in February, I shared my thoughts on losing CS teachers to the tech industy. TL;DR - I don&#39;t think it will be a CS Ed problem.
That said, I do think that it will be hard to find good CS teachers but the reason is because it will get harder and harder to find good teachers in general.
There are plenty of reasons why it&#39;s harder to become a career teacher but I don&#39;t want to talk about those today.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        The hot debate this past week in NY Education circles is Mayoral Control. When I started teaching, New York City schools were controlled by the Board of Education. The board appointed a chancellor. The system was supposed to balance community control as well as some centralized decision making. The system was created in the late 60s and was entrenched through my schooling. By the time I was a teacher I think it was pretty much a given that the system didn&#39;t work.

        If we properly prepare CS teachers, won&#39;t they just jump ship and take tech industry jobs?
I hear that a lot.
Tech pays big. Teaching? Not so much. Tech workers are respected and have flexible jobs. Teaching? Again, not so much.
Those chanting these refrains advocate the current simple teacher &#34;training&#34; - scripted lessons, minimal pedagogical content knowledge, even less real content knowledge. That will keep them in the classroom.
