        My feeds have been inundated with post after post dealing with teacher burnout, teacher shortages, government attacks on teachers and public schools. In response to one video, a friend of mine commented:
  This is going to be a crazy summer and fall. I wonder if we are witnessing the end of public education.
  Teaching was always a high attrition profession but given the stress teachers have been under since the pandemic started it&#39;s no surprise that teachers who can are leaving in droves.

        I always enjoy Fred Wilson&#39;s predictions for the new year over on his blog and this year was no exception.
 I was inspired to think a bit on his education prediction:
 K12 systems around the US (and around the world) faced with teacher shortages and desperate to erase several years of learning shortfalls, will increasingly adopt online learning services in the school building in lieu of and in addition to in-class learning.

        Lots of chatter with Donald Trump being kicked off platforms left and right. On the one hand we&#39;re getting a lot of &#34;it&#39;s censorship, it&#39;s unust&#34; and on the other side we have &#34;it&#39;s about time.&#34; I&#39;m of course in the &#34;it&#39;s about time&#34; category but even so, there&#39;s a cause for concern and a lot of meat for a discussion on tech policies.
 What makes this interesting discussion fodder is that Trump was removed from different levels of the internet.

        Teachers are back and students will soon follow either in person or remote. In person means in person one or two days a week with the rest of the time from home.
 This of course shows horrible leadership. It fails in terms of education, safety and even freeing up parents to get back to work. After all, if your kid is only in school one or two days a week it hardly allows you to get back to your own full time job.

        Yesterday, Bill de Blasio and Richard Carranza unveiled their open the schools in the fall plan.  The plan is perfectly consistent with de Blasio and Carranza&#39;s education policies and efforts in general - tone deaf, ineffective, and in this case, unsafe.
 I know we were told that part of this came from survey results but we all know that surveys are super easy to fix. I mean, ask any teacher or parent &#34;do you want schools to be open and in person in the Fall?

 In my ten years of teaching, I&#39;ve dealt with a number of situations that could have potentially turned dangerous. I&#39;ve taught in public schools and private; urban schools and rural.

        How are we going to deal with grades?  This has garnered a lot of attention since COVID-19 struck. Over on the AP side people wonder if colleges will give credit? Do the tests mean anything? What about the material they won&#39;t be testing? We also have had standardized tests canceled and a variety of grading policies.
 I&#39;m going to stay away from AP this time around - you all know my feelings about the college board.

        Continuing from yesterday, what about the article and report on pay and free teacher resources.
 The report looked at three sources - one pay and two free. They came up with a number of results but I think they largely missed the point.
 Their bottom line conclusion was that &#39;Overall, reviewers rate most of the materials as “mediocre” or “probably not worth using”.&#39; They also didn&#39;t seem to find that neither the for profit or free sources were universally better.

        There was a bit of buzz a couple of months ago when Amazon announced an online marketplace for educational resources. It wasn&#39;t a new concept - on the pay side, Teachers Pay Teachers has been around for a while and in terms of free, there are many online resources but they&#39;re not necessarily well organized or curated. What was the buzz? Should teachers be charging their peers for class materials or should they be providing them for free.
