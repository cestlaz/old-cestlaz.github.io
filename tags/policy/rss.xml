&lt;p&gt;
Lots of chatter with Donald Trump being kicked off
platforms left and right. On the one hand we&amp;#39;re getting a lot of &amp;#34;it&amp;#39;s
censorship, it&amp;#39;s unust&amp;#34; and on the other side we have &amp;#34;it&amp;#39;s about
time.&amp;#34; I&amp;#39;m of course in the &amp;#34;it&amp;#39;s about time&amp;#34; category but even so,
there&amp;#39;s a cause for concern and a lot of meat for a discussion on tech
policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What makes this interesting discussion fodder is that Trump was
removed from different levels of the internet. First you&amp;#39;ve got actual
applications like Twitter and Facebook. Next you&amp;#39;ve got the Play and
Apple stores and finally, you&amp;#39;ve got AWS which provided cloud services
to Parler. At each level the removal of Trump and others inciting hate
and violence have different ramifications and nuances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Facebook and Twitter
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First let&amp;#39;s look at Facebook and Twitter. On the one hand this is an
easy one. They&amp;#39;re not government agencies - they&amp;#39;re private
companies so the first amendment doesn&amp;#39;t apply. Next, were they
denying service to Trump? No - he had an account on both
services. What did happen is that he violated terms of service. While
I&amp;#39;d never follow Trump, I did follow an account that tweeted his
tweets. The account was set up to see if it would be suspended - guess
what, it was - more than once. This isn&amp;#39;t discrimination or
censorship, this is bouncing the unruly patron at the bar or, dare I
say removing the person who refuses to wear a mask from your store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you&amp;#39;re one of those free market regulation bad people I don&amp;#39;t want
to hear it. In this case, the market did indeed decide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is, however, a big problem and that&amp;#39;s the fact that Twitter,
Facebook and a few other players have so much power. You could argue
they&amp;#39;re de facto monopolies. For years they willingly amiplified
Trump&amp;#39;s lies and now overnight removed him. That&amp;#39;s a huge amount of
power for a company to have. People like me have felt that for years,
Facebook and Twitter have been behaving irresponsibly and as of last
week people on the right feel that way and Dorsey and Zuck can&amp;#39;t be
voted out of office. One can of course argue &amp;#34;The Market&amp;#34; but it&amp;#39;s not
that simple with the market being dominated by a small number of
players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m doubting that calls to split up the tech giants will be helpful. I
don&amp;#39;t know if we&amp;#39;re better off now as opposed to before AT&amp;amp;T split and
I&amp;#39;m not sure that strongarm regulation is the answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Enforcing open proticols, APIs and standards would probably help a
great deal but in any event, we do have a problem with big tech but
it&amp;#39;s not what the right is crying about now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
The stores and AWS
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next we have the app stores removing Parler. I&amp;#39;m guessing this is also
a violation of TOS issue but there&amp;#39;s another issue here which is
liability. Is Google or Apple liable or responsible for something on
an application they distribute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Related but different is AWS - are they responsible for things that
occur on their servers even though it&amp;#39;s Parler or whomever creates and
runs the applications running on the Amazon Cloud?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Napster enters the chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not exactly the same, but similar. For you youngsters, Napster was one
of the early file sharing services. It was basically an IRC based
setup to locate mp3 files in order to facilitate their
transfer. Napster never hosted any of the files in question but the
music industry went hard after them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even earlier you had alt.pictures.binaries. Back in the day they said
that people came to the internet for email but stayed for &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet&#34;&gt;Usenet&lt;/a&gt;
news. Basically, they were forums or chatrooms on just about any
topic. I of course subscribed to comp.lang.c,
alt.sports.basketball.nyknicks and a bunch of others. You connected to
your news server to retrieve and post messages and messages were
transferred periodically between servers. Originally using UUCP which
had computers dialing each other up on set schedules but later over
the internet. The servers didn&amp;#39;t own or even know what was in the
messages. They just stored and forwarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The question came up with binary groups - alt.pictures.binaries in
particular. Groups like alt.pictures.binaries would contain messages
with encoded images. A single image wouldn&amp;#39;t fit into a message and
messages were ascii so binary data couldn&amp;#39;t be directly sent. Images
were encode using a program called &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uuencoding&#34;&gt;uuencode&lt;/a&gt; and split into a bunch of
messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As one might expect, the binary groups ended up a place to traffic
adult and/or illegal material. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The question was were the server&amp;#39;s owners responsible? They didn&amp;#39;t
create or own the posted material. They probably weren&amp;#39;t even aware it
was on their servers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a question cloud hosts like AWS have to consider on top of
public perception and just doing what&amp;#39;s right (whatever that is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A final note on this is that Net Neutrality, while maybe not applying
in this specific instance harps on the same questions - with net
neutrality, ISPS must treat all network traffic the same. Without it
they are free to do what they want - they could slow down or block
services they don&amp;#39;t want to support. Not the same since cloud servers
are not ISPs but certainly similar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Lots of meat here and there&amp;#39;s no clear cut right thing to do. Should
the market decide? Is regulation needed? If so how much. Should it
just be at the application level or how about the cloud? The Net
Neutrality issue isn&amp;#39;t that old but when it came up nobody was talking
about the cloud and app stores as gatekeepers didn&amp;#39;t exist. Add to
that the fact that our elected officials are, let us say, not the most
up on modern tech and tech issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I can see a lot of rich discussion coming out of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>School leadership and COVID, or not</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/covid-leadership/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2020 09:48:51 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/covid-leadership/</guid>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;
Teachers are back and students will soon follow either in person or
remote. In person means in person one or two days a week with the
rest of the time from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This of course shows horrible leadership. It fails in terms of
education, safety and even freeing up parents to get back to
work. After all, if your kid is only in school one or two days a week
it hardly allows you to get back to your own full time job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course the plan gets worse. It&amp;#39;s optimized to provide the worst
possible educational experience. I won&amp;#39;t rehash the plans here but
it&amp;#39;s looking to increase the teachers workload tremendously while at
the same time killing continuity for the students (unless of course
the DOE can hire thousands of extra teachers and somehow arrange for
them to mind meld with the  main teacher). I&amp;#39;m not going to hash out
the details here but they&amp;#39;re easy enough to find on the interwebs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now in terms of leadership I&amp;#39;m not writing about De Blasio or
Carranza. We all know they&amp;#39;re absolutely horrible. It&amp;#39;s hard to
believe Carranza was actually a classroom teacher at one point and
while I&amp;#39;m no fan of Bloomberg on education at least you could say that
he had a vision, albeit an incorrect one of applying business sense to
schools and followed it while De Blasio is tone deaf, arrogant and
clueless which could make him more dangerous. I&amp;#39;m talking about in
school leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What did schools do? Well some tried to make the best of a bad
situation. They recognized that the Mayor&amp;#39;s hybrid model was bunk and
while safe full time in person is clearly the best choice, fully
remote, even with its difficulties and limitations  would be more
sound than hybrid. Add to that the fact that if a school had to go
remote midstream you&amp;#39;d be set even further back &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-reference&#34;&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;footnote-reference-1&#34; href=&#34;#footnote-1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. These schools
decided to basically set up remote from in school. Students who wanted
to or had to go to school would be sent to specific parts of the
school where they would receive the same remote instruction as their
classmates. This would accommodate students who couldn&amp;#39;t work from
home while allowing for a sensible overall schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sounds like good leadership to me and in some cases it is. On the
other hand, in some cases you have to  dig deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first question has to do with the student pods. Can they be set up
safely. What about entering and leaving? Bathrooms? Lunch? I&amp;#39;m
guessing some schools have a good plan in place but I&amp;#39;ve also heard
teachers refer to their upcoming student learning pods as &amp;#34;deathpods.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The next question has to do with teachers working from the building or
from home. The DOE decreed that unless you get a medical excemption
you &lt;strong&gt;have&lt;/strong&gt; to work from school. Who cares if you&amp;#39;re meeting students
in person or not, you &lt;strong&gt;have&lt;/strong&gt; to be there. This was ridiculous. I&amp;#39;ve
already written about it - &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/scared-teachers-scared-students/&#34;&gt;scared teachers can&amp;#39;t teach&lt;/a&gt;. This is where
leadership kicks in. I&amp;#39;ve heard through the grapevine that some
schools had teachers working from home without DOE permission. Sounds
like good leadership to me - trust your people to do the job and do
the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Recently, the DOE backpedaled and gave schools the ability to allow
teachers to work from home without medical excemptions so long as it
worked within their COVID plans. Looks like some schools are jumping
on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunately, others aren&amp;#39;t. I&amp;#39;ve heard of principals that are
setting up their schools to be &amp;#34;remote from school&amp;#34; but requiring all
teachers show up in person even though they clearly don&amp;#39;t need all of
them on site. This is the type of &amp;#34;leadership&amp;#34; I&amp;#39;ve come to expect
from many of the Bloomberg era principals I&amp;#39;ve met - you know, the
ones that barely taught for a cup of coffee. Insisting that teachers
brave the subways and share facilities like bathrooms only to spend
the day teaching in isolation serves no purpose other than to exert
power over them. If a teacher is teaching all remote and isn&amp;#39;t needed
for the pods, let them teach from home. They&amp;#39;ll be more comfortable
and thus more effective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It sounds like some principals are being true educators and leaders in
these times but many are not and in these times when we can&amp;#39;t count on
our elected officials or his appointees to do the right thing, we need
all our principals to step up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Footnotes
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr class=&#34;footnotes-separatator&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnote-definitions&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnote-definition&#34;&gt;
&lt;sup id=&#34;footnote-1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#footnote-reference-1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnote-body&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I&amp;#39;m only talking here about the general population at
the high school level. I don&amp;#39;t claim to know the best format for the
younger grades and accomodating special needs students are a whole
different kettle of fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Reopening Schools - de Blasio and Carranza throw kids and teachers under the bus.</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/reopening-schools/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Jul 2020 08:18:21 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/reopening-schools/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday, Bill de Blasio and Richard Carranza unveiled their open the
schools in the fall plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The plan is perfectly consistent with de Blasio and Carranza&amp;#39;s
education policies and efforts in general - tone deaf, ineffective,
and in this case, unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I know we were told that part of this came from survey results but we
all know that surveys are super easy to fix. I mean, ask any teacher
or parent &amp;#34;do you want schools to be open and in person in the Fall?&amp;#34;
and everyone will say &amp;#34;yes.&amp;#34; Of course, there&amp;#39;s the implication that
it&amp;#39;s safe and I bet that part didn&amp;#39;t make it in to the surveys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I didn&amp;#39;t watch the news conference live, but I was told that while
principals, parents, and children were mentioned over and over as
consulted constituents when forming the plan, somehow teachers never
came up. Typical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The basics of the plan is that students could go all remote or hybrid
and under the hybrid model, they&amp;#39;d be in the schools some days and not
others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Does this address health concerns? Doubtful. They&amp;#39;re talking about a
third to half the students attending at a time. Take a look at any
school on opening and closing - it&amp;#39;s wall to wall from the school to
the subway. It&amp;#39;s a mess. Many schools are already split schedule -
they have their kids entry and egress staggered into halves or thirds
and the beginning and end of days there are &lt;strong&gt;STILL&lt;/strong&gt; wall to wall for
blocks not to mention the subway platforms and cars. Even 1/3 isn&amp;#39;t
going to do it and the more you stagger, the more you lengthen the
school days and this affects both staff and families. What good is
having a kid go to school so you can work if they don&amp;#39;t start until
mid day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s assume, although I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a safe assumption, that you
can get the kids to and from school safety. How big are the
classrooms? I heard that some Stuy teacher&amp;#39;s measured them and they
could safely accommodate something like 9 -  12 people. That&amp;#39;s in line
with what DbD said but what about transfer between classes? Some
schools - particularly those in converted spaces have TINY halls or
limited stairwells. What about bathrooms? None of this has been
addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about cleaning? Teachers have regularly begged for basic
supplies. Schools go without necessities like toilet paper and the
Mayor&amp;#39;s saying that we&amp;#39;ll have sufficient masks and cleaning supplies?
Good luck with that! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even if we have the supplies, will they be used and used correctly and
often enough? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about compliance? For years, schools had a &amp;#34;no hats&amp;#34; policy but
rarely are there no hats. Even when the policy works, usually it&amp;#39;s a
result of teachers continually asking students to remove their
hats. How did those cell phone bans work? Do we really believe we can
get 100% compliance from students, teachers, and staff? What about the
younger grades? We really expect them to comply with adult
protocols?????&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even if everything is implemented, will it keep everyone safe?
Unlikely. Professional and big time college sports have extreme
incentive to &amp;#34;open up&amp;#34;, boatloads of money and everyone pulling in the
same direction. They test all the time, have all the space they need
and can implement whatever protocols they want. Even with all this we
keep hearing about new cases in those populations. If they can&amp;#39;t do it
how can underfunded schools?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With all of this, even if it&amp;#39;s safe and even if schools can manage
reasonable schedules, students will only be going to school a couple
of times a week - will this really help parents? Maybe not. I remember
when we had Batya. We were looking for child care for just a couple of
days a week. Five days was easy, no days was easy but just a couple -
not so much. What about the shifted days? Large schools might need 4
shifts. Kids either start and end super early or super late. Will that
help parents who work &amp;#34;regular time&amp;#34; jobs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, let&amp;#39;s get to the education side of things. High school
teachers teach five classes a day. Around 34 kids in a class. Given
room size restrictions that  means we have to split into threes. If
one teacher has to deal with this then it&amp;#39;s a HUGE increase in
work. If kids come to school on different days they&amp;#39;ll get different
live lessons - for each class teachers will have to make at least one
in person lesson and at least one corresponding remote lesson and I&amp;#39;m
over simplifying. Since you&amp;#39;re now &amp;#34;teaching&amp;#34; 10 or 15 classes instead
of 5 I don&amp;#39;t see how you can meet with them in person and deliver
synchronous remote instruction which means you&amp;#39;re only actually
interacting with your students once or twice a week and there&amp;#39;s no way
teachers will be able to actually develop materials, assess students,
and maintain meaningful contact unless someone finds a whole lot of
hours to the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, if the teacher just does the in person and another
or other teachers do the remote you&amp;#39;ll have multiple teachers teaching
a single class without any real coordination  - this is yet another
recipe for disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I get it - we all want to get back to normal. I want to be with my
students but I want to be with them safely. I also get that some
students are not doing well in isolation and that remote school is
both less effective than in person and a hardship all around but when
we open it has to make sense both in terms of safety and in terms of
education. de Blasio and Carranza&amp;#39;s plan is neither.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why are police held to such a lower standard than teachers?</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teachers-police-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 12:36:04 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teachers-police-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
My friend Neal Zupancic, actually former student, friend, and long
time teacher Neal Zupancic posted this on Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s 100% spot on. I&amp;#39;d add my two cents but Neal captured it better
than I ever could. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Take a minute to read it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In my ten years of teaching, I&amp;#39;ve dealt with a number of situations
that could have potentially turned dangerous.  I&amp;#39;ve taught in public
schools and private; urban schools and rural.  I have de-escalated
every last one of those situations.  I have never once used force.  I
once broke up a fist fight using only my voice and my presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve never felt the need to announce that before, because it&amp;#39;s just a
part of my profession.  Every teacher knows it and most of the public
knows as well.  And there are teachers who have been in far more
dangerous situations than I have.  Teachers who deal with gang
activity, drug dealers, kids who bring weapons to school with the
intent to use them, kids who fight and don&amp;#39;t necessarily stop when you
show up.  I know teachers who have been assaulted by students.  I know
teachers who have been threatened by students, including with deadly
weapons.  Every teacher is expected to deal with every one of these
situations without using force or violence.  Some of us are
well-trained, and some of us are thrown in and just go on instinct.
But we de-escalate.  We calm.  We soothe.  We help.  We repair and
restore the community.  We heal people.  We build an environment in
which those we are responsible for can thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I keep seeing people ask &amp;#34;who would want to be a cop if you could get
fired for doing your job?&amp;#34;  But literally any teacher could do that
job without killing people.  Literally any teacher would have had the
patience to talk George Floyd into getting into that police car
instead of tossing him on the ground and murdering him.  Literally any
teacher would have let Rayshard Brooks get away rather than shooting
him dead, knowing that the system would provide accountability for his
resisting arrest and that you didn&amp;#39;t have to be his executioner.
Literally any teacher knows that by the time you are in a power
struggle with a student, you have already lost.
Literally. any. teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I hear these cops whining on social media and it sickens me.  They
wouldn&amp;#39;t last a day teaching.  And of course we see that when we see
how often cops in schools arrest kids for routine behavior problems
that teachers could have solved peacefully.  We already know cops
can&amp;#39;t handle teenagers without resorting to force.  We already know
cops in schools exacerbate racism and inequality - just like they do
outside of schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And the reason for that is that we fire teachers who can&amp;#39;t control
their tempers.  We fire teachers who use force rather than let them
stay on the job and keep escalating that force until they kill
someone.  We &lt;strong&gt;weed out&lt;/strong&gt; the bad apples.  And no teacher would ever
dream of protesting or walking off the job in support of someone who
got fired for assaulting a student.  Are you kidding me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m reading posts in teacher&amp;#39;s groups about going back to school in
fall - or in some cases, in July or August to extend the school year -
without adequate protection from coronavirus, without enough room in
their halls and classrooms to socially distance, without funding for
hand sanitizer or wipes or masks, without training or PD on blended or
distance learning, without promised raises because municipalities have
lost tax revenue because of corona - and then I see cops who walk
around in body armor and work for departments that own tanks, whining
about how hard their jobs are because they&amp;#39;re finally catching flak
for shooting people, and it&amp;#39;s like - what are your priorities?  Where
is your perspective?  What kind of society do you expect to raise into
the next generation when you&amp;#39;ll fund a militarized occupying force
with impunity for homicide but you won&amp;#39;t buy teachers masks and
sanitizer during a pandemic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And teachers never, ever, ever whine like these cops do.  My
&lt;strong&gt;students&lt;/strong&gt; don&amp;#39;t even whine like these cops do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Seriously - where do they find these people?  Our job is a hundred
times harder and if we mess up even once the way cops do every day,
we&amp;#39;re out in a heartbeat.  And yet if I whined about it the way cops
whine about it, people would say &amp;#34;hey man, maybe you should stfu and
find a different job.&amp;#34;  And they&amp;#39;d be right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So to all the cops out there who think they have it rough: You ain&amp;#39;t
nothing compared to a teacher.  STFU and find a different job.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Future consequences of today&#39;s grading policies</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/grading-consequences/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
How are we going to deal with grades? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This has garnered a lot of attention since COVID-19 struck.  Over on
the AP side people wonder if colleges will give credit? Do the tests
mean anything? What about the material they won&amp;#39;t be testing? We also
have had standardized tests canceled and a variety of grading
policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m going to stay away from AP this time around - you all know my
feelings about the college board. I will leave you with a couple of
good posts though that share many of my views (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/views/2020/05/26/ap-courses-do-not-deserve-college-credit-opinion&#34;&gt;AP Courses don&amp;#39;t
deserve college credit&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&#34;https://jd2718.org/2020/05/18/retiring-advanced-placement/&#34;&gt; Retiring Advanced Placement&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The bottom line is that student and teachers lives have been severely
disrupted  since early March. In NYC public schools that means three
to four months which is a considerable chunk of the semester. In
college the percent is slightly less but it&amp;#39;s still a good chunk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some students have done fine but many have had difficulty and I&amp;#39;d
venture a guess to say most won&amp;#39;t end the semester in the same place
they would have under normal circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about this as a result of Hunter&amp;#39;s policy and I
don&amp;#39;t really have a good answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hunter decided that instructors would award grades as they normally
would. Each instructor would follow their own counsel on how to
grade. Should they be super lenient due to circumstances? Extra hard
because of perceived cheating (don&amp;#39;t get me started on this), same old
same old or some other method. Once grades were awarded, students have
the ability to change any or all classes to pass/fail. Normally if a
student takes a class pass/fail it can&amp;#39;t be used as a prerequisite or
to fill a major requirement but for this past semester, it can. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Overall I like this policy - it gives the students most of the control
and they don&amp;#39;t have to decide on anything until after the fact. The
bad part comes in though with the any passed class counting as a
prerequisite of for the major. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s say I have a student in CS1 who was doing well but really
struggled at the end after we went remote. Maybe that student was
doing A or B work up to the switch but basically got nothing out of
the rest of the semester. I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to fail the student. Under
normal circumstances, we make the false assumption that the grade is
entirely the result of the student and factors surrounding the
student&amp;#39;s environment. Even if that assumption were 100% true the Covid
Curve Ball was not the students fault and the negative impact to their
studies could not only be due to their circumstances but also due to
actions of the college or the way the instructor reacted to the
circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With Hunter&amp;#39;s policy, I could award any passing grade - even a D and
the student could convert it to a Pass and move on to CS2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The danger here is that the student might not be prepared for CS2. We
cover memory pointers, memory management, and classes at the end of
CS1. So much of CS2 is built on pointer based programs that a student
who missed out on that in CS1 is going to struggle mightily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You might say that the kid could have retaken CS1 but there&amp;#39;s a wrench
in the works. If the kid failed CS1 they could retake it. With a Pass
they can&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A student could, with the permission of some instructor audit the
missed parts of CS1 or self study but we know that won&amp;#39;t always
happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The alternative is to award a failing grade to the student which would
then hurt their GPA and force them to retake the entire course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You might say that the school could just adjust the curricula for next
year but it&amp;#39;s not that simple. In high school most students progress
in lockstep. In college there&amp;#39;s more variation. Next semester&amp;#39;s CS2
will have students who completed CS1 this past semester under the
cloud of COVID-19, students who completed it on the Fall, some from
summer and some from other places. This is where curricular
consistency is somewhat more important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I do like Hunter&amp;#39;s policy and I do think it&amp;#39;s on the side of the
student but I&amp;#39;m not happy about this loophole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This probably won&amp;#39;t affect a huge number of students but some will
fall through the cracks. As I said, I don&amp;#39;t have a good answer but it
is something I&amp;#39;m really concerned about.&lt;/p&gt;

Preamble
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve never accepted a guest post before but when my friend and long
time colleague JonAlf Dyrland-Weaver said he had something to say I
was all for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
JonAlf&amp;#39;s one of the best teachers I know - he started at Brandeis HS and
has been at Stuy forever. Really sharp guy, great teacher, and really
perceptive. When he has something to say it&amp;#39;s 100% worth listening
to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To JonAlf - since I know this is one of my blog posts you&amp;#39;ll actually
read - you should set up a blog of your own. The community would be
all the better for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
Missing out on a great opportunity in education
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-3&#34;&gt;
By JonAlf Dyrland-Weaver
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, educators across the nation are
adapting to remote learning. I’ve watched my colleagues work hard
putting together plans on how to deliver content, engage students and
assess their learning. Some, like myself, are combining multiple tools
in order to achieve these goals while others are using a single
platform for it all. I count myself lucky that the administration in
my school has given its teachers the leeway to select their own tools
instead of forcing a single platform on us. Last week, as I was
thinking through what my plan was going to be, a particular thought
kept nagging at me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-4&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-4&#34;&gt;
How much of this work will be seen?
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-4&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We are facing an amazing opportunity in the world of education. Think
of how many lessons, worksheets, notes, examples, etc. are being put
out in some electronic form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-5&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-5&#34;&gt;
How much of this work will be seen?
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-5&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Students will (hopefully) have access to the materials for their
classes, and teachers in the same school may also be able to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-6&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-6&#34;&gt;
How much of this work will never be seen?
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-6&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about the teacher three states away that’s struggling to find good resources or new problems?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-7&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-7&#34;&gt;
How much of this work will never be seen?
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-7&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about the student in a different district, perhaps one that has
shut down entirely, who just wants to learn and do some work in order
to help fill the days?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-8&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-8&#34;&gt;
How much of this work will never be seen?
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-8&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The internet gives us the ability to put all of these resources out
there to the public, and it pains me to think about how much of this
work is going to be hidden behind one platform or another. So many of
the educational technologies make it very easy to post work for your
class and very hard, if not impossible, to share it with other people
(you’re school doesn’t also have a license for XYZ?, sorry).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, there are many teachers out there that have no choice, they
are being mandated to use whatever the school decrees. There are
others, perhaps the less technically savvy, that are going to use
whatever they can get trained on quickly. We’re all running a 2 minute
drill and working with what we have. I get that, and it is not a
teacher’s job to provide materials for everyone. That being said, If
you have the knowhow, or would like to learn, there are ways to make
your work publicly available. Last summer Mike and I ran a session at
the CSTA conference on using GitHub for just this purpose, and hope to
run a workshop on it this summer (For those interested, I made a brief
tutorial about how to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teachers Pay Teachers - part 2 - the report</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teachers-pay-teachers-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2020 10:03:27 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teachers-pay-teachers-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Continuing from yesterday, what about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.govtech.com/computing/Report-Most-Teacher-Created-Online-English-Materials-Subpar.html&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/research/supplemental-curriculum-bazaar&#34;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on pay
and free teacher resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The report looked at three sources - one pay and two free. They came
up with a number of results but I think they largely missed the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Their bottom line conclusion was that &amp;#39;Overall, reviewers rate most
of the materials as “mediocre” or “probably not worth using”.&amp;#39; They
also didn&amp;#39;t seem to find that neither the for profit or free sources
were universally better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The one thing I can agree with though is that a consistent rating
system for the types of resources found on these sites would be very
helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think the main problem with the report has to do with what they were
looking for. They concluded things like the resources didn&amp;#39;t line up
well with standards, didn&amp;#39;t have good assessments, didn&amp;#39;t address
cultural diversity and a few other &amp;#34;didn&amp;#39;t dos,&amp;#34;  As I said, I think they
missed the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It felt to me that the reviewers were looking for rote
experiences. Download a lesson and follow the script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In spite of what reformers would have you think, that isn&amp;#39;t
teaching. A teacher new to a class might start with a well worked out
curriculum and largely follow it verbatim but as they develop their
chops they&amp;#39;ll want the curriculum and all related materials to become
their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A downloaded resource, taken as is, will likely not address a specific
classes cultural diversity, at least not more than in the general
sense because it was designed for the authors class and that&amp;#39;s a good
thing. It&amp;#39;s up to the person doing the downloading to take the
resource and then adapt it for their students in their situation. This
is why most of the items that the report considers bad to me are both
inevitable and fine. There is no universal lesson that you can cut and
paste to all schools. To expect it is rubbish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the CS side, there&amp;#39;s a good amount of sharing of materials as well
as providers well, providing content. Some is free some not but there
is a lot available. Forgetting about whole curricula resources, three
lesson / experience sites  I&amp;#39;m
reasonably familiar with are the SIGCSE &lt;a href=&#34;http://nifty.stanford.edu/&#34;&gt;Nifty Assignments&lt;/a&gt; and now the
CSTA&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/site/cstaniftyassignments/&#34;&gt;corresponding project&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.engage-csedu.org/&#34;&gt;Engage CS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The biggest problem with the Nifty sites is that they&amp;#39;re arranged
chronologically by the conference year they were presented. There are
no tags nor easy way to search.  Engage CS gives you some level of
searching like for course level, keyword, resource type, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The sites present resources in a format that&amp;#39;s superficially
 consistent but the truth is, once you get past the headings they can
 be written up in radically different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To me, that&amp;#39;s not a problem. Each resource was written by some
educator with the intent of sharing but since each author is unique so
to will be the content they produce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The real value of all these resources are to get ideas - lesson
motivations, code samples, project ideas etc.. Sure, I wish they were
more discoverable via search - better tagged and yes, even better
rated but the value is from reading what some other teacher has done
and then pulling out aspects that can work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve rarely used a Nifty Assignment nor something from EngageCS
explicitly but I have gotten value from both sites (CSTA Nifty
assignments are newer and I&amp;#39;ve been at all the CSTA sessions so
haven&amp;#39;t actually used the site). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Would I ever use a resources &amp;#34;as published?&amp;#34; Perhaps - if
it was really well aligned with how I do things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Would I pay? Probably not. I&amp;#39;m not against paying for resources from a
philosophical point of view. Charge a fair price and give a reasonable
assurance that what you&amp;#39;re selling has value and provide some value
beyond the free sites. I haven&amp;#39;t used Teachers Pay Teachers and
probably won&amp;#39;t look at Amazon&amp;#39;s thing when it&amp;#39;s launched but to me,
they would have to bring value in terms of curation and search. If
they do at a fair price, then they may be worth using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I started teaching there was no public internet. None of this
existed. Teachers kept binders or books of lesson plans and if you
were lucky you could borrow from a friend or colleague. New York&amp;#39;s DOE
at one point had a few teachers in each subject area submit lesson
plans for &amp;#34;lesson books&amp;#34; which they published for each core
subject. My chairman wrote some of the math ones and those materials
largely got me through my first year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today we have an embarrassment of riches. That comes with the price
that we have to actually read and evaluate all of the materials we&amp;#39;re
presented with but I&amp;#39;ll take today&amp;#39;s resources over what I started with
any day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teachers Pay Teachers  - part 1 - should they</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teachers-pay-teachers/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2020 08:43:37 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teachers-pay-teachers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
There was a bit of buzz a couple of months ago when Amazon announced
an online marketplace for educational resources. It wasn&amp;#39;t a new
concept - on the pay side, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/?msclkid=a426c2c1625613061bc19ce4cdcb6a0a&amp;amp;utm_source=bing&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Search%2520-%2520Branded%2520-%2520Desktop&amp;amp;utm_term=teachers%2520pay%2520teachers&amp;amp;utm_content=Brand%2520Name&#34;&gt;Teachers Pay Teachers&lt;/a&gt; has been around for a
while and in terms of free, there are many online resources but
they&amp;#39;re not necessarily well organized or curated. What was the buzz?
Should teachers be charging their peers for class materials or should
they be providing them for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was going to blog about it then but never got around to it The other
day, someone posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.govtech.com/computing/Report-Most-Teacher-Created-Online-English-Materials-Subpar.html&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article which questioned the quality of both
free resources and pay ones. The article, based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/research/supplemental-curriculum-bazaar&#34;&gt;this report&lt;/a&gt; by the
Fordham Institute looked at ELA resources. The report also only looked
at Teachers Pay Teachers and two free sites - ReadWriteThink and Share
My Lesson excluding many other teacher resources that could be, for
all we know, better curated and more discoverable. As an aside, I was
turned off by the reports referring to their evaluators as &amp;#34;experts&amp;#34;
which is a description I personally would question. Still, there&amp;#39;s
some good fodder for thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ll get to the report in the next post but for now let&amp;#39;s tackle the
question that started the initial buzz - should teachers be charging
each other for materials?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It depends. If you&amp;#39;re paid by a school to develop materials they
belong to the school. In NY you can take a sabbatical to build a
course so anything you build during that time would be DOE property
and therefore you couldn&amp;#39;t sell it. Same thing if you&amp;#39;re being paid
off hours to develop materials. The gray area comes when you&amp;#39;re lesson
planning. Most real planning and development happens outside of
school hours. In an typical school day teacher are typically
allocated around 40 minutes to do all their planing, grading,
and paperwork so realistically most materials as well as planing,
paperwork, and grading are done off hours. This being the case, I&amp;#39;m of
the belief that those materials belong to the teacher (although I&amp;#39;ve
met some DOE educrats who would disagree).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, should they sell it? Well, they have every right to. That said, my
personal feelings and practice is that if you&amp;#39;ve developed something
for yourself and have not spent extra time or effort to prepare it for
others then I think you should make it freely available to your
peers. On the other hand, if you spend extra time and effort to make
it useful for and usable by others then by all means charge if you&amp;#39;d
like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ll tackle the report in the next post and we&amp;#39;ll look at some of the
resources available on the CS side.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Education is not a spectator sport</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/education-not-spec-sport/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2020 08:07:26 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/education-not-spec-sport/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
As many of you know, the CS Education programs I designed here at
Hunter were finally approved by NY State late last year. We&amp;#39;re
planning to get started this summer. I&amp;#39;ve received many questions
about the program and will write up the details here sooner or later
but one question I frequently get is &amp;#34;will it be offered online?&amp;#34; This
is also something I&amp;#39;ve been asked more than once internal to Hunter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some of these requests make sense - we&amp;#39;re in the heart of NYC so
someone out on Long Island or further afield upstate won&amp;#39;t be able to
take our courses in person. This is the advantage of online
education. You can partake, or probably more often, consume it from
anywhere. Leaving out completion rates, that makes things very
attractive. Online is also very popular with bean counters. With it
you can set up practically unlimited class sizes. Lots of potential
profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, is it better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While there are certainly many things you can learn online, is it the
same? Some argue that if a professor is straight out lecturing you
might as well watch the video. Probably true but is a dynamic
professor lecturing online the same as in person?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Is a recorded concert the same as attending live? What about a
Broadway show? Sporting event?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ll listen to music at home, watch a ballgame or even a recording of
a live show but it isn&amp;#39;t the same. Even when presenter-audience
interaction and audience-audience interaction is at a minimum - say a
classical concert, the live experience is both different, superior,
and more memorable than the memorex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, there&amp;#39;s certainly value added by augmenting classes with online
content but all too often it&amp;#39;s used for cost cutting or profit
making. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://dianeravitch.net/2019/07/18/oklahoma-legislator-questions-why-state-is-giving-millions-to-virtual-charter-school/&#34;&gt;Virtual&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://dianeravitch.net/2019/08/14/ohio-gets-another-virtual-charter-school/&#34;&gt;Cyber&lt;/a&gt; Charter schools for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the end of the day education is not a spectator sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 It&amp;#39;s built on the relationship between student, teacher, and
classmates. You can get some of that online and online is great when
there are truly no other alternatives. If we can ever figure out
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/communicating-with_students/&#34;&gt;online engagement&lt;/a&gt;, then technology will be even better at augmenting
(not replacing) good, live instruction. I&amp;#39;m certainly going to look
into offering parts of my classes remotely specifically for people
outside of NY City but we&amp;#39;re a long way from remote education being
even close to as good as in person.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pushback To CS for All</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/pushback-to-csforall/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 08:27:20 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/pushback-to-csforall/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
On the last day of 2019, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/audreywatters&#34;&gt;Audrey Waters&lt;/a&gt; wrote a great piece on &lt;a href=&#34;https://hackeducation.com/2019/12/31/what-a-shitshow&#34;&gt;The 100
Worst Ed-Tech Debacles of the Decade&lt;/a&gt;. I agree with most of them but
felt it was worth looking at a one in particular. Specifically number 6 -
&amp;#34;Everyone Should earn to Code.&amp;#34;  I might dive in to some others later
but we&amp;#39;ll stick with number 6 for today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I read over these right after reading two recent posts by Alina Adam&amp;#39;s
son Gregory - a sophomore at Stuyvesant High School over on Alina&amp;#39;s blog
&lt;a href=&#34;https://newyorkschooltalk.org/2019/12/what-is-computer-science-the-doe-doesnt-know-cs4all-part-2/&#34;&gt;questioning NYC&amp;#39;s CS For All initiative&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Audrey made some very good points on CS for All (or everyone should
learn to code). It&amp;#39;s industry driven - giving them more of an outsized
influence over education and she questions the tech job crisis. I&amp;#39;ll
personally add that it&amp;#39;s problematic that so much of the emphasis -
particularly in the public schools is CS for jobs. I get it - a well
paying job is a ticket up the economic ladder and this can be a huge
deal for low income families. That said, it&amp;#39;s problematic at best when
the attitude is education for jobs for the poor and well rounded
education for life for  the rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While Audrey wrote on 100 items a few paragraphs each, Gregory wrote two
posts on CS for All in NYC and pushed back hard. One line that
resonated with me was his response to the DOE&amp;#39;s claim that &amp;#34; “Students
with computer science degrees are some of the highest-paid college
graduates”  responding with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;You know what else is a very useful skill for jobs and graduating
college? Reading comprehension and basic mathematics skills.&amp;#34; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This was a sticking point with me that got me in trouble with DOE on
the AFSE project. They insisted the high school would create industry
ready software engineers our of high school in spite of them coming in
well below grade level. They were wrong. CS is not a substitute for
other important subjects. I personally do think CS for All is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; 
important and I&amp;#39;ll address that shortly but I view it as one more
fundamental - in addition to reading and writing not at the expense
of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now let me push back on the pushback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
CS as a K12 academic discipline is very young. In NYC, things didn&amp;#39;t
really get rolling until &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/fredwilson&#34;&gt;Fred Wilson&lt;/a&gt; (from industry) started to push
things around 10 years go. There were some other small efforts at individual
schools and regions around the country. The national movement, in
spite of the CSTA being in existence for twenty years or more  didn&amp;#39;t
gain any real traction until code.org came onto the scene - also driven by
industry. While I agree very much with Audrey and other&amp;#39;s concerns
about industry&amp;#39;s outsized influence and have publicly criticized
code.org and others on it without Fred, CS Ed doesn&amp;#39;t happen in NYC
and without Hadi Partovi I&amp;#39;d guess that there wouldn&amp;#39;t be the national
push either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is all to say that the field is young so addressing what I think
are Gregory&amp;#39;s core points, depending on the teacher, a student&amp;#39;s CS
experience can be a total waste of time or it can be life changing in
a good way. This is also true of other subject areas. A bad teacher
can destroy a kid in any subject area as much as good one can
uplift. This will be more of a problem in CS until the system starts
to produce properly prepared teachers - teachers who know both the CS
content and how to teach it. That will take some time and we&amp;#39;re
starting to do that at Hunter. On the other hand, we&amp;#39;ll never get
there unless we start. In the long run, CS teachers should be of
comparable quality to teachers of other disciplines which is, of
course, another can of worms to dig into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Putting that aside, I&amp;#39;ll also push back on the pushback that teaching
CS isn&amp;#39;t valuable for everyone and I&amp;#39;ll do that on two fronts. The
first is in response to Gregory&amp;#39;s contention that &amp;#34;Computer science will
have very few applications for most people later in life.&amp;#34; While most
people won&amp;#39;t become professional programmers or software engineers
many (most?) people will work with data. It could be some deep
analysis or it could be merely managing company or personal
contacts. A rudimentary background in programming allows one to
automate data processing and focus on the core task. A much simpler
example of this is typing when writing. If you can type, you can focus
fully on the content you&amp;#39;re producing. If you can&amp;#39;t your focus is
split - part on the content and part on the keys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We teach a variety of subjects. We teach languages in spite of the
fact that we don&amp;#39;t require students learn them to fluency. Everyone
has to take some classes in the arts, multiple sciences, economics,
math - some of which makes sense and some maybe not so much, English
and more. Is CS any less important than taking a smattering of French?
How about Algebra 2 and Trig?  A year of bio, chem, and physics?
Students should be exposed to many fields and I think it would be hard
for an honest person to say that CS is less important that every
single one of the other required classes we force upon our
students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When students are struggling with fundamentals - math/English some
want to put more resources into them - usually at the expense of the
arts - there are many people, myself included that feel that this is a
 &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt; mistake. All our students should be entitled to a well rounded
education. They should take art and music, and have the opportunity to
learn an instrument. They should be exposed to a myriad of subjects,
ways of thinking, and yes, things that will lead to possible career
paths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
CS is one of these subjects. It&amp;#39;s just the new kid on the block. This is
the other reason why CS for All (beyond &amp;#34;Eveveryone should program&amp;#34;)
is so important. It&amp;#39;s not that CS should replace art or music or
another important subject but that our students deserve to be exposed
to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some will quibble that there&amp;#39;s no room but, at least in NY State
there is - I looked over the requirements and in fact, you can have 3
years of CS in High School along with all the requirements plus a
couple of other electives but I&amp;#39;m not advocating for that. I&amp;#39;m also
not sure that NY&amp;#39;s plan to have CS at every &amp;#34;grade band&amp;#34; is the right
way to go. I think that if you have the right experience you can do
right by the kids in a one year, single period high school
introduction to CS that includes programming (and I&amp;#39;m not talking
APCS-P). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, there it is. CS For All or programming for everyone might end up a
debacle and NYC&amp;#39;s CS For All might turn out to be a waste in spite of
the hard work of many strong educators but if that&amp;#39;s the case it&amp;#39;s
going to be due to implementation, politics, and influence not because
all our students won&amp;#39;t benefit from learning CS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cheating on CS projects</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/cheating-on-projects/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2019 17:33:02 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/cheating-on-projects/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Alfred Thompson posted today about &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.acthompson.net/2019/09/the-problem-of-cheating-on-programming.html&#34;&gt;cheating on CS class projects&lt;/a&gt;. It
was in response to Garth Flint&amp;#39;s post on &lt;a href=&#34;https://gflint.wordpress.com/2019/09/26/finding-cool-projects-for-programming-classes/&#34;&gt;finding interesting projects&lt;/a&gt;
which in turn referenced earlier posts by Alfred and me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Garth laments that it&amp;#39;s hard to find projects that are both
interesting and meaty but where solutions can&amp;#39;t easily be searched for
online. Alfred notes that cheating will happen and that it&amp;#39;s an ethics
issue. This is why I try to create a culture of sharing and
acknowledging credit (that is, citing sources) but I&amp;#39;m not naive
enough to believe there isn&amp;#39;t any cheating in my classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t go nuts looking out for cheating but there are a number of
things I do to try to help keep the students honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class time. More often than not students have some time in class to
work on any given project. This lets me get a handle on what they
actually know since I can interact with the student or team and
observe them interacting with each other. Even if a particular
project is all done out of class, over the course of the semester
you can get a pretty good idea as to what a student will produce on
their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project quizzes. For a big project, I&amp;#39;ll sometimes give a quiz on
the day it&amp;#39;s due. The quiz will be tied to the project - describe
a data structure or algorithm you used. If the student wrote the
project it&amp;#39;s free points, if not they&amp;#39;ll have problems. Of course,
this only requires that a student understands their project not
that they actually wrote it but at least that&amp;#39;s something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git logs. I get my students on GitHub early and that lets me look
at the commit logs for any given project. This usually can&amp;#39;t be
used to find cheating but it lets me see what was committed when. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be reasonable in terms of workload and expectations. &lt;strong&gt;This is a
really important one&lt;/strong&gt;. Back at Stuy, it was made clear to me many
times that many students feel forced to cheat due to teachers
expecting far too much from them. If you&amp;#39;re take 6 classes a day
and each gives you two hours of homework somethings got to give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I always try to give a fair amount of work and only if I think it&amp;#39;s
necessary and makes sense and as long a a student is up front about
any issues that arise I&amp;#39;ll try to work with them on deadlines and
requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I could use a code plagiarism tester like &lt;a href=&#34;https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/&#34;&gt;Moss&lt;/a&gt; but I usually don&amp;#39;t
bother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also try to keep things in perspective. Usually things come clean in
the end. Most classes have multiple measures - tests, homework,
projects, classwork and more. Even if a student copies a project and
gets away with it, it&amp;#39;s just one measure and it likely won&amp;#39;t move the
needle all that much. True, a kid who&amp;#39;s doing well might feel the need
to cheat on one assignment (see item 4 above) but that&amp;#39;s not a hill
I&amp;#39;m willing to die on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even if a kid in a 10th grade intro CS class cheats their way through
they&amp;#39;ll unlikely take any more CS as they&amp;#39;ll be woefully
unprepared. In that case, the one higher grade they got on their
transcript due to cheating on CS projects probably won&amp;#39;t make much of
an overall difference and it certainly won&amp;#39;t hurt the kids who take
all your school&amp;#39;s CS courses and apply to college to be CS majors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
None of this is to say that cheating doesn&amp;#39;t happen and I do believe
we should keep an eye out and address it if and when it rares its ugly
head. I&amp;#39;m just saying keep things in perspective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I pick projects I don&amp;#39;t pay much attention to if they can be
found online and I&amp;#39;m not the tightest screw when it comes to enforcing
the rules in my classes. I know that&amp;#39;s led to my being taken advantage
of over the years and yes, that does bother me but I&amp;#39;d rather put my
time and energy into the kids trying to do it right than those cutting
the corners.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why the Thomas Friedman&#39;s editorial on the College Board&#39;s Two Codes left me concerned</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/college-boards-two-codes/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Feb 2019 10:20:19 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/college-boards-two-codes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
There was some buzz over &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/opinion/college-board-sat-ap.html&#34;&gt;this editorial&lt;/a&gt; about the College Board last
week. The two codes every child needs - Coding and the US
Constitution? Who could argue with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m not going to disagree. Civics and CS are important and can&amp;#39;t wait
until college. The thing that left me chilled though was that nobody&amp;#39;s
paying attention to the fact that the College Board - a private entity
with its own interests has so much influence over American education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the piece, Friedman states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So rather than have SAT exams and Advanced Placement courses based on things that you cram for and forget, they are shifting them, where they can, to promote the “two codes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 2016, the College Board completely revamped its approach toA.P. computer science courses and exams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Nothing wrong here but the AP program is supposed to offer &amp;#34;college
level&amp;#34; work in high school. Back when the program started, from 
best I can figure, they offered exams based on courses that were
essentially HS implementations of college classes. Now they&amp;#39;re
flipping the script. They&amp;#39;re dictating what they think should be
taught at the high school level and, oh by the way, it&amp;#39;s college level
because it has the AP designation. The editorial goes into some
details. Now, I&amp;#39;m not against what they&amp;#39;re doing with AP US Gov, it
sounds like a really good idea. I&amp;#39;m against their overall influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The biggest concern I had though was with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides revamping the government course and the exam on that subject, Coleman and Sanford in 2014 made a staple of the regular SAT a long reading comprehension passage from one of the founding documents, such as the Constitution, or another important piece of democracy, like a great presidential speech. That said to students and teachers something the SAT had never dared say before: Some content is disproportionately more powerful and important, and if you prepare for it you will be rewarded on the SAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we put this on the SAT, schools will teach it so the kids will do
better the SAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This should be chilling to everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
No, I&amp;#39;m not against the details but it&amp;#39;s frightening to have a private
entity with so much influence on public policy like
education. Ultimately, it can&amp;#39;t be good. Just because what the College
Board&amp;#39;s pushing in terms of civics jives with me doesn&amp;#39;t mean they
should be able to influence and manipulate curriculum across the
nation to such a degree. The College Board is pretty much accountable
to nobody. As long as students are told to take AP classes and the
SAT, particularly with politicians and boards of education agreeing to
pay the college board with taxpayers money, the public has very little
say. Sure, more better civics and CS is good but who&amp;#39;s to say the next
initiative will be in the public&amp;#39;s interest?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The same can be said for any of the major education players - for and
non profit alike both in and out of CS. We have to be more aware,
vigilant, and vocal when the power players accomplish things by being
the 800 pound gorilla even when we agree with what some of those
things are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a big reason why I frequently speak out against the College
Board and other power players, some of whom I greatly like, respect,
and admire, and feel that others should feel obligated to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tech Jobs, Diversity, and Equity in the wake of the Amazon/NYC debacle</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/tech-jobs-amazon/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Feb 2019 11:14:59 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/tech-jobs-amazon/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I was planning on either following up on how I use GitHub classroom or
commenting on the recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/opinion/college-board-sat-ap.html&#34;&gt;NY Times opinion piece&lt;/a&gt; on the College Board
but the follow up, fall out, and polarization from the Amazon NY thing
has been stuck in my head so I thought I&amp;#39;d write a bit more about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Like my &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/no-amazon-hq/&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, this isn&amp;#39;t really about Amazon but rather about
the long game, equity, and diversity and how a lot of people are
fooling themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s interesting that the communities I&amp;#39;m in are fairly polarized - my
pure tech world frients are big time upset that the deal fell through while
my pure educator friends, particularly the public school ones, are
really happy things worked out the way they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The big disappointment from the tech side revolves largely around the
jobs lost. Lots of tech jobs no longer coming fast and furious. The problem is,
who&amp;#39;s going to fill them. We&amp;#39;ve been hearing for years that there&amp;#39;s a
tech talent problem. Every company at every meetup seems to say &amp;#34;oh,
and we&amp;#39;re hiring,&amp;#34; Google&amp;#39;s expanding as are, as far as I can tell,
most of the other tech giants in the city. How can both be true? If we
need those new jobs now then there must be a glut of tech people
clamoring for employment. If indeed talent is hard to find, how will
NY be able to fill this new need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We all know the answer - import them. Companies that can have and will go to
the &amp;#34;elite&amp;#34; institutions around the country and try to recruit the
talent to NY. At the end of the day the politicians can look and say
&amp;#34;behold, I have taken this slum and transformed it into a paradise&amp;#34;
and that might technically be true. Problem is that they did it by
further marginalizing and displacing those already on the fringes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s hard to see. When I was younger - before I was deeply immersed in
public education all I saw was the gentrification - look the
neighborhood has gotten better. Now I understand the cost. I&amp;#39;m reminded
of Hofstadter&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%25C3%25B6del,_Escher,_Bach&#34;&gt;GEB&lt;/a&gt; where the anteater is friends with Aunt Hillary -
an ant colony and in fact was an ant surgeon. He &amp;#34;healed&amp;#34; the colony
through strategic amputations. The colony remained healthy but at the
cost of the individuals who didn&amp;#39;t make the cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The only way all these high paying tech jobs are going to come from NY
if NY can generate them and the truth is, right now, we can&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Colleges nation wide are dealing with capacity issues. At least one
dropped its CS minor - arguably more valuable than a CS major for may
students. Stories abound on how hard it is to attract faculty and in
NYC we also have to deal with real estate issues. At Hunter, we can&amp;#39;t
just plop down a new building for CS even if we did have the money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This of course is not just a capacity issue but also a diversity and
equity one and too many players are rearranging the deck chairs on the
Titanic. Some tech players are making an honest effort to deal with
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.usv.com/blog/our-first-network-wide-diversity-inclusion-survey&#34;&gt;diversity&lt;/a&gt; and equity in a meaningful way, too many aren&amp;#39;t. I was
recently speaking with a friend at a big tech company. I was pitching
him on supporting what I&amp;#39;m building at Hunter. He said he really
wanted to help but his companies diversity plan, once you stripped
away the shiny paint was poaching from FANG (or is it FAAMG)
companies. The other thing I see is recruiting exclusively at &amp;#34;elite&amp;#34;
private schools and trying to grab as many &amp;#34;underserved&amp;#34; candidates as
possible. A third strategy involves counting everyone on your team for
diversity counts even if many of them aren&amp;#39;t really tech. Of course
the elite colleges play the same game. When you&amp;#39;ve got an incoming
class of let&amp;#39;s say 2000 and you&amp;#39;ve got 10 times that many applicants
with 4.0 GPAs and perfect test scores you can shape your class however
you want but it&amp;#39;s a zero sum game and doesn&amp;#39;t provide opportunity for
the masses.. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we want to solve these issues we have to deal with K12 and if
that&amp;#39;s the case it&amp;#39;s going to take at least 6 years maybe considerably
more before we really see results and that&amp;#39;s assuming we fix the
college capacity issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This brings me to CS for all. I&amp;#39;m a big believer in CS for All and
I&amp;#39;ve dedicated a lot of time and energy on bringing quality CS
education to the have nots but CS for All might not be the
answer. First, many of us believe that it&amp;#39;s not about turning everyone
into a software engineer. True, by exposing everyone to CS we&amp;#39;ll get a
larger pool working towards that end but the intent isn&amp;#39;t or at least
shouldn&amp;#39;t be as a feeder into the tech industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A bigger problem is ensuring that we indeed have quality CS for All
for all and that&amp;#39;s a real concern. Looking over the landscape here&amp;#39;s
what I&amp;#39;m seeing. Rich, well heeled schools are finding those few
really knowledgeable CS teachers and many of the poor schools are
getting quick and dirty training on some generic APCS-Principals
class. Dedicated hard working teachers who want to do a great job but
aren&amp;#39;t being given the time and resources to really learn CS and CS
pedagogy.  Now APCS-P can be a strong class or a weak one but in many
cases by going for the quick fix with a scripted class and then saying
&amp;#34;we&amp;#39;re done&amp;#34; is condemning those kids to sub standard CS. Even if
some do take CS1 in college my guess many will be underprepared and
many will drop. Even with a good APCS-P, the fact that no one is
paying attention to the complete pipeline and the transition from High
School to College and through the major will mean that we&amp;#39;re going to
lose many of the kids along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The answer? Good pre-service programs will help - that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m so
bullish on the program we&amp;#39;re developing at Hunter. A bad preservice
program, however - one that is based on &amp;#34;you take it you teach it&amp;#34;
won&amp;#39;t prepare our teachers to prepare our kids. Even then, we&amp;#39;re not
going to really solve the problem until we deal with little things
like, oh, you know, poverty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I might sound pessimistic. Maybe I am but it doesn&amp;#39;t change
anything. I&amp;#39;m going to do my best to affect positive change in
whatever circles I can be they large or small and many others are
doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All those jobs that aren&amp;#39;t coming to NY?  They&amp;#39;d have been filled
before any sensible fix to our NYC Tech pipeline problem yields fruit
anyway and would likely have displaced the current fringe population
rather than uplift them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>No Amazon HQ2 in NYC</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/no-amazon-hq/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 14 Feb 2019 17:57:32 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/no-amazon-hq/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
That was the big tech news today. I know there was a good deal of
vocal outrage about the deal but to be honest I was pretty surprised
by the news. Normally deals like these get steamrolled through for
better or worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have decidedly mixed feelings about this. On the one hand, I have no
problem with Amazon - I&amp;#39;ve got a bunch of former students working
there. Mostly in Seattle but at least one in NYC. On the other hand
there were a lot of things about the deal, none of them having to do
specifically with Amazon as a company that made me very uneasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s go through these issues from minor to major.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, I&amp;#39;m against special corporate incentives. In one ear I keep
hearing that these were generic incentives are available to any
company but in the other ear I keep hearing about special concessions
for Amazon. I keep thinking about stadium and Olympic deals. Those are
generally driven by politicians and money men with huge egos and from
what I can tell they generally don&amp;#39;t end up helping the little guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next we have backroom politics. Like so much in New York, it certainly
appeared that this was a back room Cuomo deal where the local
communities weren&amp;#39;t included in the process. It wreaks of Cuomo
Hubris and ego. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Third we have all the jobs. A recent poll indicated that residents
welcomed the fact that this deal would &amp;#34;create new jobs&amp;#34; but the truth
is that it would &amp;#34;create new jobs for outsiders who will come in and
replace you.&amp;#34; This isn&amp;#39;t a knock on Amazon but it&amp;#39;s probably the
truth. The history of hypergentrification is not one of uplifting the
poor into the middle class. It&amp;#39;s more like bring in the middle and
upper class from other communities and displace the poor. This would
likely be the case with this much demand for tech talent this quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The local colleges, specifically CUNY will not be able to up the flow
of tech graduates that quickly without a big infusion of resources and
that&amp;#39;s something that wasn&amp;#39;t included in the deal. It&amp;#39;s great that
Amazon is supporting HS CS but tech companies aren&amp;#39;t hiring kids out
of high school with a single introductory experience like
APCS-Principals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since New York will not be able to supply the software engineers on a
dime the companies are going to bring them in from elsewhere. I
remember talking to a tech executive a few years ago and he was
telling me that he was going to have to &amp;#34;hire X software engineers in
the next five years&amp;#34; and that while he &amp;#34;would love for them to be New
Yorkers&amp;#34; he&amp;#39;d hire them from wherever he could get them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Poor and working class people aren&amp;#39;t all of a sudden going to be
getting these high paying jobs. Sure, some will get into programs like
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pursuit.org/&#34;&gt;Pursuit&lt;/a&gt; and get entry level coder jobs and the colleges will continue
to produce what they&amp;#39;re producing now and ramp up capacity as they are
able but a lot of people  who were here during the bad times are just
going to be forced out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the end of the day most of this won&amp;#39;t change a thing one way or the
other. LIC is already on the upswing and rents are going through the
roof. Companies will continue to need tech talent in NY and NY will
continue to scramble to try to fill the need. Amazon already has a
presence in NYC and if they want to avail themselves of the talent
that comes from and wants to move to NY they&amp;#39;ll continue to build
their footprint here even without HQ2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For me the takeaway is that we have to be much more aware of all our
residents and it is our obligation as a society to work to uplift
those who haven&amp;#39;t had the same opportunities as others. That means
really looking hard at diversity, equity, and things like
gentrification. It means not just bringing in jobs without having a
plan and a path for those at the bottom of the economic ladder to
climb up into those jobs. It means working with the communities for
their and New York&amp;#39;s benefit and not making deals that sound good and
might be good for New York as a whole but get there by amputating the
parts that we just don&amp;#39;t want to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Early Ap Registration - it&#39;s, um, for the kids</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/early-ap-registration-for-the-kids/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 Feb 2019 08:08:38 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/early-ap-registration-for-the-kids/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I stumbled upon a thread over in the APCS-A Facebook group the other
day. It seems that the College Board is making some changes in their
&lt;a href=&#34;https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/about-ap/news-changes/ap-2019&#34;&gt;registration timeline&lt;/a&gt;. In the past, students registered for the exam
sometime in March with the exams administered in May. The new changes
include requiring registration in November along with $40 late
registration and cancellation fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The College Board is, of course, spinning this as for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MCNEYCZWqw&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;fbclid=IwAR04Uuj7vpHoYU_8jMjw00YpAPXp7gi3MDGdTKhzpUXv7mI0OILW01KyzvA%0A&#34;&gt;the student&amp;#39;s
benefit&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At least a portion of the teaching community thinks otherwise and has
in fact started &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.change.org/p/demand-the-college-board-not-mandate-fall-ap-exam-requirements-and-deadlines&#34;&gt;this petition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To me this is just another money grab by the College Board - an
organization that already has way too much influence over high school
education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s take a look at what the College Board actually brings to the
table. They offer an exam. A single exam in each subject offered
that&amp;#39;s supposed to in 3 hours encapsulate an entire years&amp;#39;s worth of
learning and from that, colleges might give  a student placement or
credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But you say &amp;#34;they offer so much more.&amp;#34; Do they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Teacher&amp;#39;s have to submit syllabi and the college board approves
them. They offer samples but so do text book authors and third party
organizations. In my case I rolled my own. The teacher also develops
the course. Does the College Board provide materials? I guess, but so
do those same groups that provide curricula. The college board
certainly doesn&amp;#39;t define the subject. Last I checked Calculus, was
pretty well defined way before the AP program. So was 
Chemistry, and most other subjects. Actually, due to their outsized
influence they do define the subset of the subject in some cases and
we should really be questioning this influence. Finally, the teacher does
the actual hard job of teaching the class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m  just not seeing the value added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We&amp;#39;re already seeing schools require that students take the exam to be
in the class or provide &amp;#34;incentives&amp;#34; like a credit or grade bump for
taking the exam or even removing the AP designation from the
transcript if the student doesn&amp;#39;t take the exam. Doing any of these is
just plain wrong. By all means explain the advantages and
disadvantages of taking the exam but to essentially force a student to
fork over money and personal data to an outside independent agency is
just plain wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But you say that students in many districts don&amp;#39;t have to pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is even more insidious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now it&amp;#39;s the taxpayer on the hook and the College Board has
successfully created an everlasting cash pipeline from the public into
private coffers while providing questionable value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you don&amp;#39;t agree with me and think that these requirements or
incentives  are fine ask yourself this: If you had a child in a class
and the teacher said &amp;#34;your child has to sit in a room with a friend of
mine for three hours, give them $100 and personal data and I will give
your child a higher grade&amp;#34; you&amp;#39;d be outraged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Spending three hours taking an external exam has no bearing on what a
student did or didn&amp;#39;t do in the class so the grades, credits etc
should be the same whether or not the kid took the AP exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s get back to the early registration changes. Currently kids
register for the AP exam in March. By then students might know what
college they&amp;#39;re likely to go to. They&amp;#39;ll know if the AP exam is of any
use to them. In November they don&amp;#39;t. I frequently lost some high
scores on AP exams because I had top students who were accepted early
to schools that didn&amp;#39;t award credit. I also lost a couple of low
scores of students that for whatever reasons had no chance at getting
a 3 or higher so opted not to sit for the exam. I guess the College Board came up
with a good way to get money for those kids without providing value in
return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then there are block scheduled schools or other situations where kids
don&amp;#39;t start the class until after the new November deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, let&amp;#39;s talk a bit about the College Board&amp;#39;s claim that this is
all for the students. The video talks about students doing better if
they signed up earlier. I&amp;#39;m skeptical but even if it&amp;#39;s true, is &amp;#34;doing
better on the AP exam&amp;#34; the goal we have for our students. How about
learning our subject area or being inspired to continue on with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the video, teachers talk about how the kids are more motivated and
focused because the exam. This is getting to sound a lot like the
inane focus on high stakes test where the test is the goal. Is the
motivation that &amp;#34;you paid the $100&amp;#34; so it&amp;#39;s wasted if you don&amp;#39;t do
well or &amp;#34;the school paid $100&amp;#34; so we&amp;#39;ll guilt you into studying more?
Sorry, as teachers we can do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;ll get some flak for writing this but I also suspect that
there are many teachers who agree with me that the College Board is
not looking out for students but rather themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creating a school for CS</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/creating-a-school/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/creating-a-school/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.acthompson.net/2018/09/do-we-really-need-cs-focused-high.html&#34;&gt;Do we really need CS focused high schools?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That&amp;#39;s the question Alfred Thompson asked partly in reaction to my
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/that-time-bill-gates-visited-afse&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; talking about Bill Gates&amp;#39; visit to &lt;a href=&#34;http://afsenyc.org&#34;&gt;AFSE&lt;/a&gt;, a NYC public school
with a CS focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On both posts, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/reallymdp&#34;&gt;Michael Preston&lt;/a&gt; shared some important and good points about
AFSE as a starting point and gateway that helped lead to CS4All in NYC
and also specifically about AFSE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In response to Alfred&amp;#39;s question I thought it was time I shared a bit
about what I was pushing for AFSE back when I was involved. I wasn&amp;#39;t
able to talk publicly about any of this at the time because I was
warned very sternly by one DOE person involved that I shouldn&amp;#39;t talk
to &amp;#34;outsiders&amp;#34; about my concerns or designs. In retrospect, since I
stopped getting replies to my emails and was apparently dropped from
email lists after they selected their founding principal, I probably
should have been more public about my critiques. On the other hand, I
should have been more politic internally prior to getting to that
point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Reading Alfred&amp;#39;s post, what I was pushing for AFSE at the time cuts
right to Alfred&amp;#39;s question so I thought I&amp;#39;d write about it today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before starting though I want to be &lt;strong&gt;absolutely clear&lt;/strong&gt; about one
thing. This is not a critique of AFSE as it stands. There are some
great teachers and wonderful students there and I do what I can to
support both whenever I can. This is a post about my design vs the
DOE&amp;#39;s design and later implementation. Also note that the numbers,
sizes, restrictions and designs are all based on NY state and NYC
requirements along with what one can typically do in a NYC public
school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even though it&amp;#39;s the least important issue with respect to a CS school
or not, let&amp;#39;s start by getting the dirty word out of the way. Given
the stated mission of the school (at the time) I wanted a screen. Not
a &amp;#34;Stuy test&amp;#34; screen but something. Probably something more along the
lines of the screen used by the Manhattan Science Hunter High
School. We never got that far in discussing it. My contention was and
still is that if you want to produce &amp;#34;Google ready&amp;#34; software engineers
by high school graduation, particularly in a small school, you can&amp;#39;t
start with kids 2 or 3 years behind in math. Now, if your goal isn&amp;#39;t
&amp;#34;Google ready engineers&amp;#34; but rather to use CS to engage a population
that isn&amp;#39;t otherwise engaged, I can get behind that and you don&amp;#39;t need
a screen. It&amp;#39;s important however to note it&amp;#39;s a different mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The DOE would maintain that you don&amp;#39;t need any screen and kids can
start out years behind and by the end of their senior year they&amp;#39;d be
years ahead. It doesn&amp;#39;t work that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They&amp;#39;d ask tech people at meetings what they looked for in employees
knowing that they&amp;#39;d get back &amp;#34;teamwork, creativity etc.&amp;#34; I would of
course follow up with &amp;#34;where do you look for these candidates&amp;#34; and
they&amp;#39;d say &amp;#34;MIT, Cal Tech, Harvard.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The DOE insisted on no screen. This is fine but it&amp;#39;s no surprise that
Google&amp;#39;s not beating down the doors for AFSE graduates right out of
high school and the math regents show that you indeed can&amp;#39;t take kids
from multiple years behind and end up with them multiple years ahead
given typical school resources. They&amp;#39;re doing really good work there
but there&amp;#39;s no such thing as a miracle school just hard work and
incremental progress. I have heard more than once that the founding
principal had lobbied for a screen so I feel my original assessment
was correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next up, size. The DOE insisted on a small school focused on CS. They
wanted a school of around 136 kids per grade, which makes for 4
&amp;#34;homerooms,&amp;#34; and that the school would focus on CS. My proposal was
very different. I advocated for a school with about 340 kids per grade
and not specifically focused on CS but rather with a great model CS
program - a Software Engineering Institute at the blah blah school if
you would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A small school can&amp;#39;t support a wide range of classes. With 4 classes
of kids per grade you don&amp;#39;t have a lot of schedule flexibility in
terms of class levels or electives. You also have very few teachers
per subject - for a subject taught for a full year every year for a
single period, you&amp;#39;d have one teacher per grade in that subject. If
you&amp;#39;re a school for CS you&amp;#39;re not going to be able to offer a robust
schedule of music or arts classes. Likewise an arts school is going to
be hard pressed to offer a suite of science electives. Remember,
public schools are not flush with money and can&amp;#39;t just offer loads of
courses for a handful of kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What we end up with is a school with limited offerings beyond CS and
we&amp;#39;re asking kids to decide in 8th grade if that&amp;#39;s the career path for
them. This is a hidden problem of all small schools. Kids shouldn&amp;#39;t
have to decide on their future in the 8th grade. They should all be
able to go to schools that offer a wide range of subjects to a good
degree of depth. Only large public schools can do this. I know that
public schools come with their own problems but this is one of the
trade offs. I believe that having this selection done in 8th grade
along with the tech stereotypes and preconceptions is a big part of
the schools difficulty in appealing to girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now even if every student who applied and is randomly accepted into
AFSE does indeed want to be a CS person then we&amp;#39;ve also lost because
we&amp;#39;ve done nothing to get more kids into the pool. It could still
potentially function as a model school in terms of courses or possibly
pedagogy but it won&amp;#39;t expose and inspire anyone new with respect to
tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s contrast that with what I proposed. I wanted around 340 kids per
grade or 10 &amp;#34;homerooms.&amp;#34; How did I arrive at that number? It wasn&amp;#39;t
just a guess. Schools like Stuyvesant or Brooklyn Tech are clearly too
large and impersonal but small 136 kids per grade schools are too
small. The 10 homeroom per grade school seems to be the best
compromise. There are enough teachers so that there&amp;#39;s institutional
memory when one leaves, enough of them and students for a varied set
of electives. It also means that there are enough teachers to avoid
bad fits between teacher and student. At the same time, it&amp;#39;s not so
large that kids get lost. I also spoke with some of the best
programmers I know - not computer programmers but people who schedule
students for classes in schools and this seems to be the best
compromise size range. Also, with this size you don&amp;#39;t necessarily need
a screen if you want &amp;#34;Google ready&amp;#34; software engineers. There will be
enough of a range kids that come in behind and kids that come in ahead
can get what they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also didn&amp;#39;t want it to be a CS school but rather a school with great
CS. That way it would appeal to a range of students. Kids who think
they want to do CS and those who don&amp;#39;t. At the end of they day some of
the kids that think they wanted CS won&amp;#39;t want it and those kids will
have other options. At the same time some of the non-tech kids will
take the required CS and find out that &amp;#34;this is neat stuff&amp;#34; and we get
to increase the number of people in the tent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I still believe my design would have worked out better but that&amp;#39;s not
to say that I don&amp;#39;t think that AFSE has been and is important. As Mike
pointed out in his comment, AFSE was the first unscreened school to
offer legit and it did (and does) offer a place for CS kids that don&amp;#39;t
get into or don&amp;#39;t want to go to a place like Stuy which is very much a
large school and an unforgiving machine. It was also a showpiece that
helped pave the way for CS in all NYC schools. All of that&amp;#39;s good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I do regret parts of what went down between me and DOE. I don&amp;#39;t regret
sticking to my beliefs in terms of school design but I would like to
have been able to handle the politics of the situation better. Had I
remained involved I think I had more to offer. I don&amp;#39;t regret it too
much – at the time it went from the DOE telling me one week to &amp;#34;you
can have any role in the school you want&amp;#34; to the next week &amp;#34;we want to
introduce you to the person who we&amp;#39;re making principal&amp;#34; and I
recognize that I&amp;#39;d have a hard time putting that aside now and the me
of a decade ago would have found it impossible. That said, I think
everyone would have been better off if both sides could have played
things better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;d still love to have the chance someday to set up and run a school
of my design with my team. It&amp;#39;ll probably never happen but it would be
nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Giving control of NYC&#39;s specialized schools to a political appointee</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/shsat-part2/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/shsat-part2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday I shared my thoughts on Bill de Blasio&amp;#39;s plans to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; the
selection criteria for New York City&amp;#39;s specialized high schools. If
you haven&amp;#39;t read the post, you can find it &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/shsat/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was going to get back to CS and CS Ed related blogging today but
there&amp;#39;s more to the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In spite of what BdB stated, it&amp;#39;s not enough for him to switch to another
measure - the middle school state exam along with some modifiers. This
is about ending the exam altogether and not replacing it with anything
better. Here&amp;#39;s a link to information on the proposed legislation for
&lt;a href=&#34;https://legiscan.com/NY/bill/A10427/2017&#34;&gt;New York Assembly Bill 10427&lt;/a&gt; including links to the actual text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s a lot of beurobabble but the end game is to basically allow
the chancellor (not sure if this means city or state) to do whatever
they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here are some of the key points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seats would ultimately go to the top 5 to 7 percent of each middle school&amp;#39;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These students would have to also be classified in the top 25% city wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top is defined by a composite score of multiple measures as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;determined by the chancellor which means anything goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remaining seats will be filled by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;lottery of all students with a 3.7 GPA or greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not clear how the students would be allocated to each of the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;specialized schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, what does this all mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Multiple measures could mean the state test + average. It could mean
average + recommendation. It could be shoe size + favorite color. The
chancellor also decides how to weight these multiple measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This means that the politicians can do whatever they want to paint any
picture they want regardless of how their ideological and political
games hurt kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Any teacher, in fact, any rational adult  will tell you that middle
schools are not interchangeable. The top students at one middle school
are typically not at the same level as top students at another
one. I&amp;#39;m sure you can cluster middle schools in terms of the students
they graduate, what the students know and can do and the clusters will
likely fall on economic lines. This is the problem that BdB should be
addressing not how to rig the specialized school admissions stats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even if this is done right, you&amp;#39;re assuming an even distribution of
top gifted students across all the middle schools. If one school has
higher concentration of gifted students, they&amp;#39;re out of luck. The end
result is that if you attend an SP or other gifted program for eighth
grade you&amp;#39;ll likely be locked out of the specialized schools. What if
a particular middle school is attractive to all of our top math team
talent? Only a couple will get in to the specialized schools under the
new system since each school is allocated a fixed number of slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I guess this does make sense if you don&amp;#39;t believe in gifted students
or gifted education but then why not just get rid of the specialized
schools to begin with rather than playing these games. This &amp;#34;solution&amp;#34;
will result in parents having to decide - do I send my kids to the
gifted middle school program and hurt their chances to get into a
specialized high school or do I try to find the lowest performing
school I can find and have my kid stand out. This is pretty messed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the end of the day, though, you have to remember that any change to
the process can help one group and hurt another. Stuy, for example has
46% of it&amp;#39;s students on free or reduced lunch and is about 70%
Asian. If in the new system you&amp;#39;re increasing the percent population
of an under represented group, you&amp;#39;re likely reducing the percentage
of Asian students. So, you&amp;#39;re creating opportunities for a number of as of yet
undetermined students (who might not be properly prepared for the
experience) at the expense of economically disadvantaged Asian
students who have proven to be prepared for the experience. Wouldn&amp;#39;t
a better solution be to fix the opportunities presented at the middle
schools rather than rig the system of high school acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Going further, a response on another blog noted that BdB probably
refused to do anything with the admissions criteria of the non big
three because they all had numbers that he would consider more
diverse. The commenter provided the Black / Latino percentages, I added the
free and reduced lunch numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border-spacing=&#34;10px&#34; frame=&#34;border&#34;&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;School&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Percent Black / Latino&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Free / Reduced Lunch&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Brooklyn Latin&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;28%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;61%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;HSMSE&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;26%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;46%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;HSAS&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;17%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;25%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Queens Sci&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;64%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All the more reason to run some tests or analysis there. Of course, if
you look further you&amp;#39;ll note that HSAS only has 25% of its students on
free or reduced lunch so is it really doing better than Stuy or Sci
with ~45% low income students  each  or Brooklyn Tech which supports
62% or are we to say that there&amp;#39;s low income and then there&amp;#39;s the
right low income?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Certainly the education system needs work but the proposed legislation
is not a solution. It&amp;#39;s taking a flawed but objective measure and
replacing it with essentially chancellor&amp;#39;s discretion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the legislation passes, by the year 2022 we will have admissions to
what used to be some of the nations finest high schools determined by
a political appointee rather than an objective test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s a shame. It was very important to my wife and me to have our kids
go to public schools and I was very happy to have been able to
navigate the system with them from first grade through high school
graduation with only a few bumps along the way. With this nonsense
from the political left and the privatization push from the political
right (or actually both sides) pretty soon there will be nothing left.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Changing Admissions to the NYC Specialized High Schools</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/shsat/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 03 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>
&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday, Bill de Blasio, the current Mayor of New York City outlined
how he would &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; our specialized schools. The schools he was
referring to were the &amp;#34;big three&amp;#34; of Stuyvesant, Bronx Science, and
Brooklyn Tech and then five additional schools - The High School  for
Math Science and Engineering at CCNY, The High School for American
Studies at Lehman, Brooklyn Latin, The Queens Arts and Science High
School at
York College, and Staten Island Tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All use a single SAT style test, the SHSAT, for admission. The Big Three are
locked into that system unless there are changes made by the state
legislature. The Mayor can make changes to the admissions criteria of
the other five on his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The problem, as stated by Chalkbeat writers Alex Zimmerman and  Monica
Disare is that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city’s specialized high schools — considered some of the crown
jewels of New York City’s education system — accept students based on
a single test score. Over the last decade, they have come under fire
for offering admissions to few students of color: While two-thirds of
city students are black or Hispanic, only about 10 percent of
admissions offers to those schools go to black or Hispanic students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I normally don&amp;#39;t write about things like this but given my history at
and with Stuyvesant I thought I should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before getting started, my biases - I believe in public schools, not
charters, I also believe that a system should have gifted programs and
magnet schools and also a mix of large comprehensive schools and
smaller niche ones. Additionally, while I do believe in gifted
programs I&amp;#39;m not sure at what point it makes sense to start offering
them. When we were looking at elementary schools for our own kids we
opted for a neighborhood public school rather than applying to the
district gifted program as we felt it offered a better overall
education. On the other hand, had our kids not made Stuyvesant, I&amp;#39;m
not sure what we would have done. Part of that was due to the fact
that the Bloomberg administration destroyed just about all the large
comprehensive schools so, other than that large test schools and
LaGuardia, good luck finding a school that was strong in the
humanities, sciences and offered a robust music program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
The overall picture
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For reference, here are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theschoolboards.com/showthread.php/4324-Specialized-High-School-SHSAT-Cutoff-Scores-for-2018&#34;&gt;unofficial cutoff scores&lt;/a&gt; for the specialized
schools from 2018 along with the NY State data on free and reduced
lunch for 2017. Note that there&amp;#39;s overlap between the schools. I
separated out SI Tech since geography probably affects it&amp;#39;s numbers
more than the other schools and I separated the big three from the
remaining four because I think the three are all substantially larger. The
free and reduced lunch percent is important because I believe an
entire school qualifies for Title I funding if the number&amp;#39;s
over 40 so while these schools are not populated entirely by low
income students, all but HSAS has a substantial number and there&amp;#39;s a
chance, some say a good one that at best BdB&amp;#39;s plans will merely
shuffle which low income kids get in rather than actually solving the
root problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
The plan
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-3&#34;&gt;
Part 1 - test prep
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s idea here is that test prep is rampant for SHSAT and that the
test can be gamed. This may or may not be true but if it is then it&amp;#39;s
safe to assume that a lot of low income kids are doing test
prep either by prioritizing test prep programs in family budgets,
working off of an SHSAT test prep book or by attending a middle school
that has some form of prep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There has long been a program on the books called &amp;#34;The Discovery
Program&amp;#34; which has a free city run test prep component and also a
summer component. The summer component is for low income students who
score within &amp;#34;a few points&amp;#34; of the school in question&amp;#39;s cutoff
score. At the end of the summer, I believe the students retest and in
general make the school in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This program is a good thing and should be reinstated&lt;/strong&gt; but I don&amp;#39;t
know if it will result in the changes that BdB is looking for. More
likely Stuy will get its discovery kids from Science and Science from
Tech. As there are already many low income students at all of the
schools there&amp;#39;s no indication that this would increase the number of
under represented groups which is BdB&amp;#39;s goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s also worth noting that there&amp;#39;s a sizable chunk of Brooklyn Tech
students that don&amp;#39;t perform particularly well on regents exams.
Everyone knows I&amp;#39;m not a fan of standardized tests and I don&amp;#39;t
believe that students that score a &amp;#34;few points&amp;#34; lower on the SHSAT are
any less qualified to be in a specialized school but at the lowest
performing end of these schools, one has to ask how specialized is it
really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-4&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-4&#34;&gt;
Part 2 - use state test scores instead of the SHSAT
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-4&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This &lt;strong&gt;could be&lt;/strong&gt; a &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; good thing with one major caveat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Twenty one middle schools produce over half the students that
ultimately are accepted to the specialized schools. For the rest,
there are a few reasons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many students don&amp;#39;t take the SHSAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been stories of schools steering kids away from the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;specialized schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no culture in those schools of striving for specialized&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;school acceptance or attendance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The academic programs at those schools don&amp;#39;t prepare students for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the SHSAT exam for reasons that we&amp;#39;re not going to delve into here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All students already take the NY State middle school Math and English
exams. Yes, it would further raise the stakes for those exams but it
would ensure that the specialized schools are on the map for everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The big question here is &amp;#34;do the current state exams cover enough
material in enough depth to select and differentiate for gifted
programs.&amp;#34; I don&amp;#39;t know the answer to this question. If they don&amp;#39;t
then using state test scores will be a disaster. If they do, then they
could be a suitable alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-5&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-5&#34;&gt;
Part 3 - admissions from every middle school
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-5&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is the third part of BdB&amp;#39;s proposal - guarantee admissions to the
top 10% of students at every middle school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This could be a real disaster either for the students or for the
schools. There&amp;#39;s no question that students coming out of different
middle schools are at different levels of preparedness for the
specialized schools. Arguably the most obvious difference is that some
middle schools offer algebra and others don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For better or worse, the specialized school&amp;#39;s curricula, classes, and
overall programs have evolved hand in hand with the exam. If you all
of a sudden end up placing a large number of students with a
different and arguable weaker academic profile into these schools one
of two things will happen. Either the students will struggle immensely
or the school will have to lower its standards. There&amp;#39;s no two ways
about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you set standards for academic preparedness for the specialized
schools either by making a hard cutoff on an exam score be it state or
SHSAT and then spread those acceptances across all the schools maybe
it could work. If not, you&amp;#39;re setting up students with high grades at
schools with weak programs up for failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another problem is what to do with non-public school students -
private schools, charters which take public money but act as private
schools, parochial, and home school students. Where do they fall in to
this equation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-6&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-6&#34;&gt;
Is one measure bad?
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-6&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So there you have my thoughts on BdB&amp;#39;s specific proposals but I also
want to address his contention that a single measure is bad and makes
the comparison to colleges where they by and large use multiple
measures. This is a ridiculous comparison. Yes, colleges look at
multiple measures but after watching decades of Stuy students go off
to college, it&amp;#39;s clear to me that the process is by no means fair or
consistent. Elite schools can easily game their acceptances and
they still can have 100% of their applicants with off the charts SAT
scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A single test might not be ideal but it can only be gamed by test prep
and test prep can be as cheap as buying a test prep book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As to other measures that come up from time to time - interviews,
portfolios, essays - who does that help? The low income kid or the
well to do one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you&amp;#39;re going to add another measure for admission it has to be
something that can&amp;#39;t be gamed or politically influenced,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-7&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-7&#34;&gt;
Alternatives
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-7&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Should the city address the fact that there are groups that are under
represented at the specialized schools? Certainly, or rather, the city
should address deficiencies in opportunities that are like the causes
of this under representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Should the city be doing things differently? Also yes. Here are some
thoughts on what the city can and should be doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-8&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-8&#34;&gt;
Do the experiments in the non-big three.
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-8&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are five specialized schools that aren&amp;#39;t covered by state
legislation. Why not run your experiments there. You&amp;#39;ve got  the big
three as a control group and what&amp;#39;s more if you look at the
&amp;#34;acceptance score windows&amp;#34; in the table above, you&amp;#39;ll see that there&amp;#39;s
enough overlap that you can probably get some real data out of these
experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why not change the admissions criteria for one or two of them and see
how it goes before jumping in whole hog. Figure out if anything works first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-9&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-9&#34;&gt;
Check existing data
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-9&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We&amp;#39;ve got SHSAT results and State Test score results along with
student grades for years. Why not study correlations between
them. Rather than making a specious claim about middle school grades
in NYC Public Schools vs state tests vs the SHSAT, run the
numbers. Take a look at student high school performance based on these
predictions. This shouldn&amp;#39;t be guess work and city should have the
data to do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-10&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-10&#34;&gt;
Fix the middle schools
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-10&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This one is more pie in the sky because no politician really wants to
take this one but you&amp;#39;ve got to look at what&amp;#39;s going on in the middle
schools and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I tweeted this the other day:&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;would love to see this experiment - take the entire staff / faculty / admin of one of the 20 or so middle schools that are the primary feeders to the spec schls and swap them with another middle school and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Mike Zamansky (@zamansky) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/zamansky/status/1003074760786501632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;June 3, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The truth is that if you did this, the high performing school would
probably continue to be high performing and the low performing one
would still struggle. There&amp;#39;s only so much a teacher can do. A school
with a disadvantaged population needs the resources to succeed - lower
class sizes for a start. Add wraparound services, extensive after
school and weekend opportunities - make the schools a part of the
community and maybe we can get somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another question relating to our schools in general is to look at
attrition rates to private schools - how many students in our under
represented groups are being siphoned off to private schools on
scholarship. I don&amp;#39;t have any data for this. It could be an
insignificant amount or it could go a long way in explaining the
downturn in the numbers over the decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-11&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-11&#34;&gt;
So where are we
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-11&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are a lot of changes I&amp;#39;d love to see in our public schools and I
do believe BdB&amp;#39;s heart is in the right place. I&amp;#39;m concerned that some
of the solutions that he and other politicians come up with will hurt
the current low income students at the specialized schools and
unintentionally advantage the well to do while not helping those that
at least BdB may honestly want to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He should enact Discovery and research the State Tests but proceed
with caution. The test schools have always been and continue to be a
gateway for poor and immigrant students and any changes that are
proposed should be weighed carefully and &lt;strong&gt;tested&lt;/strong&gt; before taking steps
that could real harm when good is intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Should CS for All be implemented at the college level?</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/csforall-in-college/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 25 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/csforall-in-college/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s been a lively discussion on pushback to CS for All at the K12
level over on Facebook. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/guzdial&#34;&gt;Mark Guzdial&lt;/a&gt; started a sub thread asking if CS
for All should first be implemented at the undergrad level rather than K12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s an interesting question and as good as anything to get me out of
my month long non-blogging rut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Mark was right when he said that if Colleges implement CS for All, K12 will
likely do so to follow - just look at AP. Colleges have been saying
that students should take more AP classes (while giving less credit)
and we all know where that&amp;#39;s led.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, can colleges really do CS for All, what does it
mean and what would it look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Much like there is no single K12 - it&amp;#39;s 50 states and who knows how
many independent school districts, there won&amp;#39;t be a single CS for All
at the college level but let&amp;#39;s think about how things could play out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many colleges have distribution requirements. Students must take one
course from bucket A, two from bucket B etc. Many schools that I&amp;#39;ve
looked at already  count CS courses in one of their distribution
buckets. This doesn&amp;#39;t mean every student will take CS but in theory
means they can. Colleges could in theory create a required CS bucket
or even a required CS course but I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s as easy as
that. It might be at a private institution but while I don&amp;#39;t know all
the ins and outs of Hunter&amp;#39;s governance rules I do know that adding a
universal student requirement is a HUGE undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So my take is that while it might be easy for a private college
to add a CS requirement I&amp;#39;m guessing other public institutions are
more similar to Hunter and it&amp;#39;s not going to be an easy task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Regardless, let&amp;#39;s say we have a required class on the books. Will we
have the capacity to teach it? It seems that schools are struggling to deal
with their existing CS majors and running sufficient electives and
courses for them. Just a month or so ago there was an article about a
college ending its CS minor due to lack of resources. It doesn&amp;#39;t sound
like a radically different problem then that faced in K12. Maybe it&amp;#39;s
harder given that at least in NY, there is &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/room-for-csforall&#34;&gt;room for a required CS
course&lt;/a&gt; if you can find the teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even so, assuming we have the capacity to enroll every undergrad in a
CS course what would that be? I think most people would be in
agreement that it shouldn&amp;#39;t be CS 101. Maybe existing pre-major
courses but even there I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s always the best
path. There could be a great pre-major course to give students the
basics and lead some into the major but what about a CS course for
students in majors that need some deeper but focussed programming
skills. The appropriate course for them isn&amp;#39;t the same as a
general/pre-major course. Using Statistics as an example, at Hunter,
many majors require a statistics course which is off loaded to the
Stats department. Each major has slightly different requirements. Over
years, the end result is a course that it seems that nobody is happy
with - a least common denominator course. CS for All at the college level
could give us a least common denominator course that doesn&amp;#39;t serve
anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, if you have the resources, none of these are issues. A well
heeled private institution can run tons of sections of specialized
classes no problem but this means just like on the K12 level we&amp;#39;ll
get the CS for All tale of two cities that I see coming in NY where
the rich schools have good programs and the poor get a substandard
experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With all of this said, I&amp;#39;m finally getting to the big red flag with
college CS for All and it&amp;#39;s an issue that everyone conveniently
ignores. I&amp;#39;m talking about teacher quality. One of my big takeaways
from SIGCSE is that college faculty are well behind K12 teachers in
terms of pedagogy and I don&amp;#39;t see this changing anytime soon. This is
to be expected given that professor&amp;#39;s career advancement is really
based on research. Having a good teacher is always important but it&amp;#39;s
even more important for non-major students since a student in the
professor&amp;#39;s major will at least be passionate about the subject
area. To me, this is not a recipe for success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One can certainly make the claim that we aren&amp;#39;t any better off right
now at the K12 level because we don&amp;#39;t have teachers who know either
the subject nor how to teach it and at least at the college level they
know the subject matter. This is very true and it&amp;#39;s why pre-service CS
teacher preparation is so critical to getting this right even though
it will take time. That&amp;#39;s something that both Mark and I have been
vocal about but more on that subject next time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is there room for CS for All</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/room-for-csforall/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/room-for-csforall/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
A fear revolving around CS For All concerns where will the money
come from and how will we fit in the new classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One suggested solution is to integrate CS into other subjects. I
thought I&amp;#39;d write today about why I don&amp;#39;t think the fear is valid and
while integrating CS into other classes can have value, it probably
isn&amp;#39;t a long term solution for CS education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s start with the integration solution. The idea is to bring CS
into an existing class. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bootstrapworld.org/&#34;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;, a program I&amp;#39;ve written about before
and one of the programs I like does this, primarily in Algebra. The
idea is that this supports the student&amp;#39;s learning Algebra while
exposing them to CS. It&amp;#39;s a nice program but a math teacher using
Bootstrap shouldn&amp;#39;t be confused with a computer science
teacher. They&amp;#39;re bringing some CS to their student and engaging the
students in a different way mathematically and that&amp;#39;s all great but in
general you can&amp;#39;t take two classes worth of material and concepts and
fit them into one class and the number of teachers who are truly
knowledgable in any two academic subject areas both in content and
pedagogical content knowledge is few. I&amp;#39;m guessing that one of the
reasons that Bootstrap works in Algebra is the alignment of the
toolset and Algebra and how you can teach it. The other is that
Algebra is frequently given more time for fewer topics. In some
struggling schools, students might have two years of algebra or a
double period so there&amp;#39;s time to add in some CS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m all for cross curricular work. You can look at applications of
science in math classes, do mathy work in a CS class, run stats and
data analysis in math and CS classes on materials from History classes
and all of this is great. You can even create great combined curricula
where you do indeed teach multiple subjects in an integrated way but
to think that you can take what is typically taught in two different
classes and you can combine both so that they&amp;#39;re taught in one class
with one teacher sounds fishy to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, at the end of the day, if you go the integration approach you&amp;#39;re
either going to have to dedicate a similar set of resources both in
time and personel to having independent courses. The alternative is
that CS will be the second class subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, let&amp;#39;s look at actually bringing in CS For All as a separate
course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here are the New York State Graduation Requirements [fn::The state
lists by credits which are a year, I doubled the numbers to map to semesters]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Subject&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;Number of semesters&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;English&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Soc Studies&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Science&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Math&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;LOTE&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Arts&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Phys Ed&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Health&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Electives&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Total&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;align-right&#34;&gt;44&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It can be difficult to fit Phys Ed in since it has to be offered every
semester so let&amp;#39;s double the Phys Ed requirement to 8 semesters. What
is actually normally done is to have 7.5 periods of science a week and
2.5 periods of Gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This means that the basic student program uses 48 class slots and
includes 7 elective slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In terms of exit exams, students have to pass the following Regents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;English&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any single math (Algebra, Geometery, Alg 2 / Trig)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any single Social Studies (US History or Global History&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any single Science (Living Env (bio), Chem, Phys, Earth Science)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any additional Regents exam&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The requirement of passing a single Math regents is what leads to the
extra time allocated to Algebra that I mentioned when discussing
integrating CS into Algebra above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To get an Advanced Regents diploma you have to pass additional exams -
both history, all three math, three science and maybe more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using a Typical 7 period plus lunch day, we have room for 56 single
semeter classes in a high school career. This means that assuming
students aren&amp;#39;t failing too many classes, even with the extra Phys Ed
allocation I mentioned above  we can easily fit computer
science into our day. In fact, we can technically fit in four full
years assuming a student doesn&amp;#39;t have to repeat any class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So in New York state we certainly have the time but what about the
budget? That&amp;#39;s not an issue either. The state also requires that
students recieve 5.5 hours of instruction a day exclusive of
lunch. At 47 minute periods, that translates to students being
assigned 7 instructional classes a day which means we can&amp;#39;t just give
the kids the required 44. We have to fill all 56 available class slots
over those four years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course it&amp;#39;s not really that simple. Students fail classes and have
to repeat them and some classes might be assigned more time than
others but it looks to me like we should be able to fit
computer science in without any big budgetary or scheduling
changes. The challenge will be finding the teacher and working the
internal politics and policies since as computer science comes in it
will mean removing some electives even if those electives are additional years
of science, math, or English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Programs like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tealsk12.org/&#34;&gt;TEALS&lt;/a&gt; and Bootstrap are important transitional programs
and even when we do have qualified CS teachers they will play an
important role - TEALS in providing industry support and resources and
Bootstrap by integrating curricular areas and over time as preservice
programs start to appear the rest will work itself out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unfunded Mandates and CS For All</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/unfunded-mandates/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/unfunded-mandates/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
This morning, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/guzdial&#34;&gt;Mark Guzdial&lt;/a&gt; wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;https://computinged.wordpress.com/2018/04/27/lack-of-funding-leads-to-lack-of-teachers-leads-to-lack-of-cs-classes-we-may-need-to-change-our-strategy/&#34;&gt;unfunded mandates and CS for
All&lt;/a&gt;. Unfunded mandates frequently wreak havoc on schools in a number
of ways but in the long run, I don&amp;#39;t think it should have a severe
effect on CS for All. Rather, it could have a big impact on the number
of CS courses we offer beyond that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Mark relay&amp;#39;s a story from the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School where
at the time many students wanted more CS classes but the school wasn&amp;#39;t
planning on hiring a new CS teacher. The money quote is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 50 percent of students signing up for Level 2 [computer science] courses next year identify as African Americans,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
No, I&amp;#39;m not talking about the diversity issue raised by the quote, I&amp;#39;m
talking about &lt;strong&gt;Level 2 [computer science]&lt;/strong&gt;. This implies that the
students already had &lt;strong&gt;Level 1 computer science&lt;/strong&gt;. Level 1 would cover
CS For All so now we&amp;#39;re talking about CS electives vs other
electives. This is something I had to deal with for most of my career
even after we got a CS requirement at Stuy. It was always a battle to
hire enough CS teachers to meet demand. The hard part was politics -
there were always older more entrenched subject areas who would rather
force kids into their electives rather than allow them to take my CS
electives. This is a whole other kettle of fish than CS for All. It&amp;#39;s
an issue for some schools now and will become a &lt;strong&gt;BIG&lt;/strong&gt; issue in five to
fifteen years when a single CS required course is more the norm. The
issue raised here is a new CS elective vs entrenched teachers and
classes which shuld lead to a discussion of the relative value of CS
electives vs other electives. That said, the reality is that it
usually comes down to school and local power and politics. Also to be
considered is the potential ebb and flow of interest - there might be
demand for 5 more CS classes and 5 less something else this year but
there might not be next year and then we&amp;#39;re in real trouble staffing
wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Schools, public high schools in particular are zero sum endeavors. You
have a fixed number of periods a day, specific class requirements, and
certain mandates as to a the minimum and maximum number of classes a
student can take. In New York City, I believe students are required to
have a &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; schedule which basically means they can&amp;#39;t come in for
English, Math, and History and then go home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With CS for All, you&amp;#39;re basically allocating reallocating some amount
of time to computer science. It might be hard to find a qualified
teacher. particularly in a small school where the population won&amp;#39;t
support a full time CS teacher and it might ruffle the feathers of the
teachers that will be losing the time but it shouldn&amp;#39;t make much of a
dent or really any dent on the budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Mark also raises the possibility of embedding CS into other subject
classes. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bootstrapworld.org/&#34;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; is a program that I&amp;#39;m rather fond of that does
just this in Algebra classes (although more recently they&amp;#39;re working
to branch out into other subject areas). Even though I&amp;#39;m a big
Bootstrap fan I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s the answer to CS for All or CS in
the high schools in general. I think that one of the reasons why
Bootstrap works so well is the alignment between the CS tool they use
and the way Algebra is or can be taught. Another reason is the fact
that while Algebra is the lowest level of the traditional high school
classes, it&amp;#39;s frequently the one for which the most time is
allocated. Students in low performing schools might take Algebra over
two years or have a double period. This won&amp;#39;t be the case for other
subject areas. What this means is that there&amp;#39;s more likely extra time
to embed another subject, cs, into the Algebra class. Long term,
embedding CS into another subject area requires:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a teacher that really knows both subjects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;enough time so you can add all the cool CS content while still&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;preparing the students for both the next level of whatever subject
you&amp;#39;re embedded in  as well as for whatever standardized
assessments come at the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I said, I&amp;#39;m a Bootstrap fan but I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s the answer for
CS in K12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back to the original topic there are certainly issues with
implementing CS for All but I don&amp;#39;t think school funding is the
biggest hurdle. For me there are other big challenges. One is having a
supply of qualified teachers. In the long run as states outline CS
requirements and pre-service programs crop up this will work itself
out. Until then, yes, we will have an issue and yes it will take some
funding for stop gap and transitional teacher preperation. A second issue is
working the internal politics. Adding CS does mean removing something
else or more likely a piece of something else. The third one is what
I&amp;#39;m noticing in NY where CS for all seems to at times forget about
the CS. If we have knowledgeable teachers we can work around that one
but I still think that might be my biggest concern.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Strong K12 Teacher Certification is Important</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/strong-teacher-certification/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/strong-teacher-certification/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
About a week ago New York State&amp;#39;s new regulation creating a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20180327/NEWS/180329893/new-york-will-finally-have-certified-computer-science-teachers&#34;&gt;K12 CS
teacher certification&lt;/a&gt; went live. Just the other day I was honored to be
interviewed by  &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mflamm_reporter&#34;&gt;Matt Flamm&lt;/a&gt; of Crain&amp;#39;s New York in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20180410/TECHNOLOGY/180419999/asked-answered-teacher-changed-jobs-to-push-for-new-york-states-new&#34;&gt;follow up piece&lt;/a&gt;
about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Having K12 CS teacher certification is big and having quality programs
that lead to certification is &lt;strong&gt;HUGE&lt;/strong&gt;. In my view, it&amp;#39;s a game changer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s Focus on high school, my wheelhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From a course offerings point of view it&amp;#39;s the wild west. I don&amp;#39;t mean
this as a bad thing, it&amp;#39;s just that there&amp;#39;s a huge range of offerings
from AP to home brew, physical computing, game based, cyber security,
you name it, there&amp;#39;s a curriculum. The long and short of this is that
schools need teachers to teach all of these experiences. Without a
strong certification pathway we&amp;#39;re going to be stuck with the current
training based model where teachers are trained to deliver canned
curricula rather than truly teach. With strong teacher preparation
programs teachers will be prepared not only to deliver all the
existing curricula but, arguable more importantly design their own
learning experiences appropriate for the populations they work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is important and alone would make having CS certification
worthwhile but to me the BIG win is that it creates a viable career
path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
People say we&amp;#39;ll never find enough CS teachers because the tech
industry pays so well. I&amp;#39;ve never believed that. We find math teachers
even though many could flee to finance and chem teachers in spite of
big pharma&amp;#39;s call so why can&amp;#39;t we find CS teachers? Because we&amp;#39;ve
never provided a path into the profession and a viable career track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Certification means that over time schools will be able to build CS
teachers and the discipline will be treated as the other
subjects. Prior to certification, a CS teacher might be cut if a
school&amp;#39;s math department downsized. With certification, the career
track for a CS teacher is the same as the track for any other teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It also means that young people starting out who are interested in
both teaching and computer science will have a way of getting into the
profession - something that has never before existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Having CS certification alone won&amp;#39;t woo a
plethora of current tech professionals into teaching but over time,
we&amp;#39;ll start to have CS Ed majors or CS majors pursuing CS ED Masters
degrees and entering the profession. This won&amp;#39;t happen in a press or
election cycle but it will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This all hinges on quality prep programs. I think I&amp;#39;ve hit the sweet
spot with what I&amp;#39;ve designed at Hunter. The critical components are of
course content and pedagogy. Teacher candidates must have both
sufficient depth and breadth in the subject and all the pedagogical
content knowledge that comes along with it. I don&amp;#39;t agree with the
common approach of taking a course to teach a course - that is, having
courses like &amp;#34;APCS - Principles for teachers&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;APCS - A for
teachers.&amp;#34;  I want my teachers to be able to teach any reasonable
curriculum or design their own so we&amp;#39;ll be rolling out courses that
examine the commonly offerd curricula but prepare teachers for a whole
lot more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s been an exciting week in NY CS Ed and there&amp;#39;s a lot more to come.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fixing the Absent Teacher Reserve (ATR) situation</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/atrs/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
In the New York City department of education a recurring hot topic is
the Absent Teacher Reserve or ATR pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A teacher or administrator in the ATR pool is a licensed, most likely
tenured teacher not assigned permanently to a school. Each year these
educators get shuttled from school to school and denied a chance to
actually settle in a position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The ATR pool was created under the Bloomberg administration. Prior to
that, when there was an opening school transfers were basically
seniority based and when school had too many teachers the least senior
was excessed or basically out of a job until a school with an opening
could be found. The Bloomberg plan allowed teachers to use criteria
other than seniority for transfers but so as not to violate the
contract agreed to by both parties, teachers who were excessed, as
they might not be least senior, were kept on as employees and put in
the pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
ATR&amp;#39;s would rotate from school to school. Sometimes for a couple of
week but more recently for a year at a time. When at a school for only
a couple of weeks they could only be used as subs or for grunt work
but even when there for a year they&amp;#39;re treated like second class
citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The ATR pool grew in size when the Bloomberg/Klein DOE went on the war
path, set schools up to fail and closed them left and right. If you
had the bad luck being at a close out school when it closed then, hello
ATR pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Over the years, the press, ed reformers and politicians have unfairly
bashed this group of educators. They&amp;#39;ve falsely claimed that these are
criminal teachers or unsatisfactory teachers. That&amp;#39;s a blatant
lie. Teachers up on charges are removed from schools and await a
hearing in another draconian process set up to violate teacher&amp;#39;s
rights. If a teacher is ultimately found guilty, they are disciplined
or fired. If exonerated, they&amp;#39;re returned to their schools. In any
case they&amp;#39;re not ATRs. Teachers that are repeatedly found to be
unsatisfactory are likewise removed (although the process here is
ridiculous and unfair as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
ATRs like any pool of teachers run the gamut. Some are great, some are
poor, many will fall in between. All are stigmatized and treated like
damaged goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
People ask, how can a good teacher get into the ATR pool? As I said,
be at a closeout school. In the year before I was able to bring my friend
and former colleague JonAlf over to Stuy, he was at Brandeis High
School - a
closeout school. I tried to bring him over that year but his principal
wouldn&amp;#39;t release him. Had I not been successful in bringing him over
the following year he might very well have ended up in the ATR pool
and he&amp;#39;s one of the best teachers I know. What about the teacher that
doesn&amp;#39;t want to abandon those kids that the DOE abandoned when they
decided to close the school. That martyr teacher surely ends up in the
ATR pool but that&amp;#39;s the type of dedicated teacher every principal
should want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So now we have a bunch of stigmatized teachers looking for work in a
system that won&amp;#39;t give them a chance. Not only due to them being
considered &amp;#34;damaged goods&amp;#34; but also because they&amp;#39;re expensive to
hire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When a school gets an ATR to them, it&amp;#39;s free - the cost isn&amp;#39;t added to
their budget - they keep them as extra manpower for the year and then
throw them out with the trash. At times, they get some credit for
keeping them a second year and even beyond they can get rid of them
whenever they want. Great way to bust the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A clear example of this is Stuy&amp;#39;s  current math chair. He&amp;#39;s an ATR
Assistant Principal. They got him for free for the first year and I
believe at a 50% discount for the second and even now they can dump
him whenever they want. This is rubbish – he&amp;#39;s either good enough for
the position or he&amp;#39;s not. If he is, he should be given the job for
real and if he isn&amp;#39;t then what is he still doing there. I&amp;#39;m not making
any value judgment on him or the department but it&amp;#39;s either one or the
other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, a big reason for this ATR mess is about budgets and money. The
problem is that it&amp;#39;s a big lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The DOE pretends the we have a situation like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/atr1.png&#34; alt=&#34;/img/atr1.png&#34; title=&#34;/img/atr1.png&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; height=&#34;250&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The DOE has money and schools have money. The schools pay for their
teachers, supplies, and everything else but the ATRS are paid for by
the DOE. Of course this isn&amp;#39;t the case. The truth is that the DOE pays
for everything:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/atr2.png&#34; alt=&#34;/img/atr2.png&#34; title=&#34;/img/atr2.png&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; height=&#34;250&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
ALL the money comes from the DOE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the past the DOE has come up with poorly conceived and poorly
received plans on how to deal with the ATR situation but it&amp;#39;s really
quite simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Start by recognizing that ALL the money comes from the DOE. Once you
do that you can address the problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assign the ATR to a school&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the school likes the ATR and the ATR likes the school, they keep&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;them and the DOE picks up the tab or rather adjusts the schools
budget to compensate. The DOE will continue to do so until a real
opening occurs at the school in the ATR&amp;#39;s area at which point the
ATR fills the position officially and the budget is readjusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the school or ATR don&amp;#39;t like each other the ATR gets rotated,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;however you create a 3 strikes (or maybe 2 or 4 or some number)
rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the school keeps sending away ATRs semester after semester hit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;them with a penalty or force an ATR placement when they have an
opening (assuming the ATR is amenable).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the ATR keeps declining positions after a set number of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;schools force the placement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That&amp;#39;s it. Simple and solves the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New York State moving forward with CS Teacher Certification</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ny-cs-certificate/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 12 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ny-cs-certificate/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Last April I woke up early and trekked up to Albany along with a few
of my Hunter College colleagues to share our thoughts on K12 Computer
Science teacher certification with the Board of Regents. We gave a
presentation to the Regents Higher Education Committee and afterwards
had a chance to talk with some of the Regents as well as other members
of the New York State Department of Education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I left feeling that our proposals were well received and I think
everyone present - both the Hunter and NYSED contingents hoped that
things would move forward on this important issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fast forward to today, December 8, 2017. I was up at the crack
of dawn. Driving in the dark in the snow from NYC to Albany to once
again attend a Board of Regents Higher Education Committee
meeting. This time, the agenda item was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposed Amendments to Part 30 of the Regents Rules and Section 52.21
and Part 80 the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education Relating
to a New Certification Area and Tenure Area for Computer Science&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
No discussion or debate this time around just the proposal. If I
understand the process correctly, this should come up again at the
March meeting at which point it will be voted on. If approved, it
looks like we&amp;#39;ll have a pathway towards certification for CS teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I haven&amp;#39;t had a chance to dive into the details but at the meeting a
few key points came up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the proposal indicates this will be a subject area in which a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;teacher can be certified and be awarded tenure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a traditional pathway for new teachers - Bachelors /&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masters degree&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be an alternative pathway for people entering from the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;workforce&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be an extension for teachers with another license so they&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;won&amp;#39;t have to give up tenure in their current license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be an &amp;#34;individual evaluation&amp;#34; pathway which sounds to me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;like it could catch people who fall through the cracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There looks to be a sensible ramp up period - until September 2022&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a grandfathering provision that looks to last 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds like a smart sensible plan. Multiple pathways, shallow
ramp up and provisions to protect existing teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, the devil is in the details. What&amp;#39;s an approved program?
Can a grandfathered teacher teach all CS classes or just intro ones?
etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I said, I haven&amp;#39;t had a chance to dive into the details yet but
this is very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Prior to the meeting I was chatting with a few other people
attending. One, a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uft.org/&#34;&gt;UFT&lt;/a&gt; representative was very excited about the
prospect. Another contingent, a group from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nysut.org/&#34;&gt;NYSUT&lt;/a&gt; was very much against
a new certification area. Their position was that this would create a
teacher shortage because no one would have a CS license and no one
would get one due to the difference in salary between teaching and the
tech industry. I&amp;#39;ve already written on how I feel that this is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/will-we-lose-cs-teachers-to-industry&#34;&gt;red
herring&lt;/a&gt;. What shocked me though was their feeling that &amp;#34;we already
have many non-CS teachers effectively teaching CS across the
state. They&amp;#39;re doing a great job and don&amp;#39;t need any additional content
or pedagogical knowledge.&amp;#34; I think they&amp;#39;re wrong and I also think that
when we as a community talk about how our summer professional
development is all that&amp;#39;s needed, we undercut CS education and
the teaching profession as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any event this was a big step for New York. I tried to individually
thank as many of the participants as I could for helping shepherd this
along but could only speak to a few so I&amp;#39;ll just give a blanket thank
you here to the NY State Board of Regents, Board of Education and
State Education department.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A test result is just a test result</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ap-results-measure-of-curriculum/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 15 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ap-results-measure-of-curriculum/</guid>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;
This past weekend was &lt;a href=&#34;http://catskillsconf.com&#34;&gt;Catskillsconf&lt;/a&gt; - my favorite event of the
year. I spent the weekend up in Ulster County with a bunch of my
students. some great friends old and new, and Devorah. It was a great
weekend but I was mostly offline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a result I missed a rather heated discussion in the CS Ed Facebook
groups. The debate was over whether or not Strong AP CSP exam results
are indicative of a good curriculum or good professional development (PD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
TL;DR - NO!!!!!
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Further, anyone who thinks that a set of exam results can tell you
that a particular PD sequence or curriculum is good shouldn&amp;#39;t be
allowed to call themselves a teacher and I don&amp;#39;t want them anywhere
near my kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I guess that language is strong, even for me but it&amp;#39;s true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tests are designed to assess students and many tests don&amp;#39;t even do
that well. They shouldn&amp;#39;t be used to measure something further
removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The last time this idea made its rounds was using student test results
for teacher evaluation. They do that in NY. A judge called the
practice &amp;#34;capricious&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;arbitrary.&amp;#34; My friend and former
colleague Gary Rubinstein showed a year or so ago that standardized
test scores varied enough from year to year so as to make the ratings
useless [fn::sorry, I just got back from the weekend trip and am too tired
to find the link. You can go to his site and search and while you&amp;#39;re
there, there&amp;#39;s lots of good stuff to read.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using test scores to say a PD sequence is good? What if that PD
focused on test prep? What if it did nothing in particular? When I was
at Stuy and when I was at Seward Park the Calc teachers&amp;#39; students had
great AP results. I can tell you that none of those teachers had any
quality PD specific to AP Calc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Curriculum? My mentor and friend Danny Jaye told me many times - &amp;#34;A
great teacher can save a class from a  horrible curriculum but a great
curriculum will do nothing for a class with a horrible teacher.&amp;#34; He
was right. Again, what if the curriculum encourages test prep. What if
pressure on the teacher encourages them to focus on test prep
regardless of curriculum or PD (see my recent &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/standards-who-for&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An AP test measures one thing - how well the student did on the AP
test. There are so many variables that go into a class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it first period at 8:00am?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it the last class of the day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it before lunch or right afterwards?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about right after Gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s the mix of students - every class is different&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the teacher teaching the subject once a day? Two times? Five&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;times?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How large is the class&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many other classes are the kids taking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list goes on and on. There are so many contributing factors that
you just can&amp;#39;t say &amp;#34;Good test results = good curriculum&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;good test
results = good PD.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Want to know if a curriculum is good - have experienced teachers who
know their subject run it a few times through and ask them. Same for
PD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Teachers know education a lot better than test makers, curriculum
developers and PD providers. How about listening to them for a change?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Standards - Who are they for?</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/standards-who-for/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/standards-who-for/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The big push at last year&amp;#39;s CSTA conference was the release of the new
CSTA K12 standards. It seemed that every other session was pushing
them in one way or another. I&amp;#39;ve been meaning to share my thoughts
about them or, more specifically, learning standards in general for a
while but with announcement about federal funding for CS coming from
the White House last week I thought it was time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before diving into CS standards lets talk about math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To start I have yet to meet a math teacher that needs
&amp;#34;the Standards&amp;#34; to know what to teach. Some how or other math teachers know
they&amp;#39;re supposed to teach in an algebra or geometry class. When NY
moved to &amp;#34;integrated math&amp;#34; teachers were able to re-sequence classes
without the benefit of &amp;#34;the standards&amp;#34; and when NY went back to
Algebra, Geometry, then Alg 2 and Trig, teachers had no problem
reorganizing classes again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
New teachers didn&amp;#39;t go to &amp;#34;the Standards&amp;#34; to learn the ropes. Schools
defined syllabi, teachers observed each other, shared resources, used
lesson plan books and in general knew what they were supposed to teach
and at what level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In my quarter century of teaching, always in a math department we
spent a lot of time talking about what we taught, when we taught it,
how we taught it and at what level but until common core was forced
down our throats we NEVER discussed &amp;#34;the Standards.&amp;#34; We discussed our
students, where we thought we could take them, and how to get them
there. Somehow our students did alright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
More recently, the push has been on &amp;#34;The Standards,&amp;#34; common core in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Common standards sound good - kids in every school will learn the same
things at the same level - but I contend that they aren&amp;#39;t about
learning. They&amp;#39;re about testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s look at a few of the math standards. These were pulled directly
from the Common Core:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derive the equation of a circle of given center and radius using the
Pythagorean Theorem; complete the square to find the center and radius
of a circle given by an equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use coordinates to prove simple geometric theorems algebraically. For
example, prove or disprove that a figure defined by four given points
in the coordinate plane is a rectangle; prove or disprove that the
point (1, √3) lies on the circle centered at the origin and containing
the point (0, 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Derive using similarity the fact that the length of the arc
intercepted by an angle is proportional to the radius, and define the
radian measure of the angle as the constant of proportionality; derive
the formula for the area of a sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These aren&amp;#39;t about deep thinking and problem solving. They&amp;#39;re about
very specific skills or techniques. They&amp;#39;re also easy to put on a
test. Much easier then assessing a students real problem solving ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Common Core comes hand in hand with standardized testing which is then
used to punish students, teachers, and schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We keep hearing about individualized instruction - meeting the kids
where they are but the standards tell us that kids MUST know specific
things at specific times. You can&amp;#39;t have both. In the best case, with
&amp;#34;the standards&amp;#34; we can only meet students &amp;#34;where they are&amp;#34; within
annual bands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What has this led to? Narrowing curriculum for one thing. Since schools are
evaluated based on the standardized exam in core subjects focus
narrows and other subjects fall by the wayside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Arguably worse is selective teaching within common core subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Take for example, Geometry. The course is really &amp;#34;Logic and Deductive
Reasoning using Euclidean Geometry as a Platform&amp;#34; but it&amp;#39;s generally
called Geometry. This class is supposed to be about getting kids to
think. I&amp;#39;ve already shared a few standards above but let me tell you
about an open secret - many schools don&amp;#39;t really teach proof -
arguably the most important part of the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In my last year at Stuy I graded Geometry regents for the city. I
graded exams for two highly regarded unscreened schools. One that was
lauded in a State of the Union address and the other equally hyped. I
graded all of each school&amp;#39;s students geometry regents so it wasn&amp;#39;t
just a sampling. Out of all the papers, only two or three scored more
than 2 out of 9 points for the proof question and most were entirely
left blank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What happened? Proof is hard to teach and hard to learn but it&amp;#39;s also
only a small part of the standardized exam. It&amp;#39;s critical for a
school&amp;#39;s survival and for the student to graduate that a passing score
is earned. Rather than spending a large amount of time on few points
and probably get a limited return I&amp;#39;ve been told that many schools
spend much more time on topics that area easier to teach and have more
weight on the exam. This makes the school look better and helps the
student graduate but arguably the most important aspect of the course
has been minimized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
High stakes testing leads to gaming the system. Common core standards
come hand in hand with high stakes testing. We see the same with AP
exams - there are schools that force students to take exams even when
they are woefully prepared and mostly fail because this helps the
school shoot up in the ratings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is what the common core math standards have given us. They&amp;#39;re not
for teachers - we don&amp;#39;t need them - we know what to teach and only
wish that the bean counters would indeed allow us to meet students
where they are. Standards are about testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s move on to CS standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It might not be fair to compare CS to math since K12 math education
has been around much longer and is more well defined and in theory
having a set of standards gives us a common language to discuss,
compare, and contrast all the content providers and curriculum
developers out there. On the other hand, I also believe that with well
prepared teachers who understand content and pedagogy the value isn&amp;#39;t
all that great. It&amp;#39;s also worth considering the fact that nothing
really makes the CSTA Standard  writers special. There&amp;#39;s no reason to
think that another group - be they a handful of teachers or a content
provider can&amp;#39;t do a comparable job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here are some selections from the CSTA standards:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design and develop a software artifact working in a team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Compare and contrast various software licensing schemes (e.g., open source, freeware,
commercial).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Design, develop, and implement a computing artifact that responds to an event (e.g., robot
that responds to a sensor, mobile app that responds to a text message, sprite that responds
to a broadcas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Demonstrate the value of abstraction for managing problem complexity (e.g., using a list
instead of discrete variables).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Design algorithms u sing sequence, selection, and iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Discuss techniques used to store, process, and retrieve different amounts of information
(e.g., files, databases, data warehouses).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Compare and debate the positive and negative impacts of computing on behavior and
culture (e.g., evolution from hitchhiking to ridesharing apps, online accommodation rental
services).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Use simple encryption and decryption algorithms to transmit/receive an encrypted
message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Decompose a problem by creating new data types, functions, or classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Evaluate algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching) in terms of their efficiency, correctness, and
clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Use data analysis to identify significant patterns in complex systems (e.g., take existing data
sets and make sense of them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with these. They aren&amp;#39;t specific enough to
develop lessons from but, they can provide a
consistent framework to discuss different offerings. Were the much
more specific, we&amp;#39;d have the same issue I railed about with the math
standards so this is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Actually, in general, I don&amp;#39;t have a problem with these standards. I
might agree with some parts and disagree with others but that&amp;#39;s
neither here nor there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To me the big concern on standards is what will they actually be used
for. It&amp;#39;s nice to think that it&amp;#39;s a set of guidelines from which we
can develop strong local experiences but I think this is somewhat
naive. As states and the federal government bring CS Education into
the fold there&amp;#39;s no reason to believe that CS will be special. CS Ed
will go the way of other subject areas. That means that whatever
standards governments adopt, they will likely be used for high stakes
tests rather than for true education. If you look to see how the
sausage is made you can see the harm standards and standardized
testing has wrought  in subjects like math. CS Ed won&amp;#39;t be far behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While we should be proud of all the work that&amp;#39;s going on in our
community it&amp;#39;s more important now than ever to keep an eye on the
overall big picture and be aware of how work intended for one purpose
within the community can be used very differently by those outside of
it. This is particularly important for advocates  not in public schools. Public
schools educate the majority of American students so CS4All means
public schools. Standardized testing won&amp;#39;t affect private schools (or
private charters in many cases) nor will they affect colleges and in
fact will be a boon to EdTech companies selling there wares. Many of
the loudest voices in CSEd come from these contingents - it&amp;#39;s
important that they look to the greater issues, form their own
opinions, and then act on what they believe is right.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is the new Secret Sauce ever better?</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/is-the-new-secret-sauce-ever-better/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/is-the-new-secret-sauce-ever-better/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I read &lt;a href=&#34;http://nancyebailey.com/2017/09/05/xq-super-schools-business-working-to-end-public-high-schools/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; piece earlier today on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/NancyEBailey1&#34;&gt;Nancy Bailey&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
TL;DR (although it really isn&amp;#39;t too long so you should read it) - it&amp;#39;s
on Laurene Powell Jobs, her efforts to &amp;#34;reform&amp;#34; education and why
she&amp;#39;s misguided as are most of the well to do non-educators working
hard to change and in many cases privatize public education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Laura posts a nice list of simple, common sense ways to improve
education. I&amp;#39;ll repost them here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, research has shown that high school students need more sleep. They should have later start times. .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smaller class sizes would help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure teachers don’t have so many preparation plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End advanced placement classes (IMHO).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improve career-technical classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provide rich extra-curricular activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring back life skill classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Include a social justice curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Include students on the disciplinary board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provide civics education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure students get opportunities to participate in the arts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work to include the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensure students have access to counselors, and school support staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every high school should have a great library, a real librarian, and technology and books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks very much like what those elite private schools that those rich
non-educators send their kids to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The other day I also overheard a conversation between two
professors. One noted that they had just taught a course totally
online for the first time and that the professor really had fun doing
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These got me thinking more about all the secret sauce and magic
bullets coming from tech to save education - things like MOOCS or  &amp;#34;personalized&amp;#34;
learning system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I started to wonder - have these &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ever&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; been pushed on public
schools because they&amp;#39;re better or rather because they cut costs (or in
the slightly better case to reach a student that otherwise wouldn&amp;#39;t
have any opportunity which, in a way is generally cost related).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I couldn&amp;#39;t come up with a single instance. They&amp;#39;re always a way to
replace what I consider personalized instruction – you know, when a
teacher has a small class and can personally deal with, learn about,
interact with, and teach the child. Kids spend hours in front of a
screen instead of working with others. Kids do a MOOC (or maybe drop
out of a MOOC) so that you can have your student/teacher ratio reach
ridiculous levels. I&amp;#39;ve never seen any tech solution rolled out to
public schools because it&amp;#39;s better. Only to cut costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How do I know that it&amp;#39;s not better? Well, we have Nancy&amp;#39;s list
above. It&amp;#39;s what those rich people pay all that money to the elite
private schools for.  If all these solutions the Jobs and Gates of the
world were so much better, wouldn&amp;#39;t they insist upon them  for their
own children?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Just some Friday food for thought.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Cost of AP Exams</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cost-of-ap-exams/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cost-of-ap-exams/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Now that I&amp;#39;m back from vacation and summer&amp;#39;s winding down I thought
I&amp;#39;d start getting back to more classroom related posts. I still have a
few summer topics I want to write about – standards and side projects
in particular but I&amp;#39;m also looking forward to talking more about the
classroom since, after all, at my core, I&amp;#39;m a teacher. When I saw &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2017/08/how_online_textbooks_could_help_more_students_take_ap_exams.html&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;
article in my inbox this morning I thought I&amp;#39;d talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the piece, Lindsey Tepe since more kids are taking AP classes and
they&amp;#39;re very expensive, schools should look to lower other costs
related to AP classes so as to provide financial support so that
students can take that oh so important end of year exam:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the College Board continues to reimburse about one-third of the
test cost for eligible low-income students, only about half of states
are now offering any further financial assistance for students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ms. Tepe&amp;#39;s solution? Lower text book costs. As a way of lowering
school costs, I&amp;#39;m all for it. I&amp;#39;ve used free online resources in lieu
of textbooks for years but the savings should go somewhere where it
can make a difference. Perhaps lowering class sizes. The fatal flaw in
Ms. Teps&amp;#39;s piece is that it continues spinning the misplaced narrative
that AP Exams are a very important part of a child&amp;#39;s education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s be reminded of something: The AP Exam is one thing - an exam - a
single test at the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The narrative is that students should take more and more AP classes,
that they&amp;#39;re somehow better for kids. Part of this is due to the
potential college credit and part is because the public has been
bamboozled by the ridiculous school ratings that give credit for AP
classes taken. Back in &amp;#34;the day,&amp;#34; AP classes were basically early
college. You could then argue that they were the most rigorous classes
offered in a school. AP Calc was basically college Calc. Same for
APCS-AB, AP-Bio and the rest. Now, with classes like APCS-P aimed to
be accessible to typical high school students in the lower grades,
they can&amp;#39;t (but still will) make that claim. In fact, at Stuy, my
former school, there are plenty of non AP classes that are more
rigorous than AP classes and the best AP teachers don&amp;#39;t always cover
the whole syllabus because they&amp;#39;re more concerned with their students
actually learning rather than scoring 5 on an exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the college credit front, if a student has a high probability of
saving money through AP credit then I&amp;#39;m all for it but otherwise, it&amp;#39;s
just money going to the college board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It seems ridiculous for me to have to write this but the important
part of a class is, you know, the class. Not the single exam given by
an outside agency at the end and graded after the semester concludes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My suggestion? Offer college level work to students that are ready for
it but don&amp;#39;t push the AP exam. This would save a ton of money. What value
does the college board actually bring to the table? Remember, they&amp;#39;re
making a pretty penny on all of this testing. A math teacher should be
able to teach calculus with or without AP. A good text being used by
that teacher in class - be it free or paid for is actually much more
important to a student learning calculus than a single exam taken at
the end of the year. I&amp;#39;d go further and say that I&amp;#39;d trust the
teacher&amp;#39;s exam more than the college board&amp;#39;s. If a teacher knows the
math but needs to see some sample syllabi, they&amp;#39;re a web search
way. The same is true for most other college courses that have AP
equivalents and maybe even more so for computer science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the end of the day it should be about students learning not about
students taking high stakes exams.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thoughts on non educator  influences on CS Education</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/outside-influences-on-cs-ed/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 29 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/outside-influences-on-cs-ed/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/guzdial&#34;&gt;Mark Guzdial&lt;/a&gt; blogged about a NY Times piece discussing
&lt;a href=&#34;https://computinged.wordpress.com/2017/07/28/silicon-valley-pushing-coding-into-american-classrooms-through-code-org-nytimes/&#34;&gt;Silicon Valleys influence on education through Code.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Mark questioned the validity of the piece. If you don&amp;#39;t read Mark&amp;#39;s
blog and you&amp;#39;re in CS Ed you probably should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I tried to leave a comment on Mark&amp;#39;s blog - not about the NY Times
article but rather my thoughts on why I think it&amp;#39;s important that we
remain wary and vigilant to industry and outsiders influence and
impact on CS education and on education in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t know if my comment is sitting waiting for Mark to moderate or
if I&amp;#39;m experiencing WordPress weirdness but since it hasn&amp;#39;t shown up
there, I thought I&amp;#39;d share it here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While the article might not make a strong case it&amp;#39;s important to be wary of outside influences on education policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m a fan of a lot of what code.org does but speaking about outsiders in general…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Bill Gates and Co. directly or indirecty gave us such delights like stack ranking teachers, improving, I mean evaluating, I mean firing teachers based on test scores of students they don&amp;#39;t teach, more and more high stakes nonsense testing for kids, and  at least in NY the destruction of neighborhood schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They&amp;#39;ve also pushed the current charter movement that, aided by misleading stats appear successful but in truth are no better and frequently worse than public schools while not sharing back a single &amp;#34;best practice.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then we have private companies like the College Board and Pearson both of whom have an outsized influence on US Ed policy and curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t doubt the good intentions of code.org - as I said, I&amp;#39;m a fan. I am concerned when they and others take actions that can affect ed policy. I&amp;#39;m concerned when code.org representative pushes students to take an AP exam - not a great CS course with a great CS teacher but the actual exam. I&amp;#39;m even more concerned when code.org offers free PD when a school signs up for the PSAT8/9 - another high stakes meaningless test at taxpayer expense. For code.org it&amp;#39;s a means to  get more CS ed out there. To me it&amp;#39;s setting up a new cash cow for the college board at my expense and at students expense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve seen many Ed Tech people, armed with the best intentions, enter the lions den – a school, district, or municipality only to see their best intentions corrupted in the name of cost cutting, profits, or politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>CS Ed advocates should pay attention to greater ed issues</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cs-ed-and-all-ed/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cs-ed-and-all-ed/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
For anyone involved in K12 CS education, the past few years have been
a wild ride. When I first tried to make inroads in the DOE decades ago
I couldn&amp;#39;t get through the door. Now, CS Education is everyone&amp;#39;s
darling. It&amp;#39;s really amazing. It&amp;#39;s been a combination of grass roots
efforts by teachers, non profit education efforts such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://teals12k.org&#34;&gt;TEALS&lt;/a&gt;, advocacy of
groups like &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.org&#34;&gt;Code.org&lt;/a&gt; and amazing individuals like &lt;a href=&#34;http://avc.com/2017/06/bearing-witness/&#34;&gt;Fred Wilson&lt;/a&gt; who has
probably done more to move the needle of CS Ed in NY than any other 10
people combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While everyone agrees that to do CS education right at the K12 level
we need great teachers and lots of them, everyone also knows that
teachers voices are often unheard. The voices with the greatest weight
belong to the large non-profits, principals, superintendents and
local politicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today&amp;#39;s post is a plea to those with voices to think about the effects
of their advocacy for CS Ed to the greater education landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I started thinking about this recently as I&amp;#39;ve been developing the
CS teacher certification programs for Hunter College. As I spoke to
people across the nation I found that many of the efforts to
developing teacher certification are what I call the &amp;#34;you take it you
teach it&amp;#34; model. You take an abbreviated version of APCS-A and APCS-P
and you&amp;#39;re a certified CS teacher. Just about every real educator feels
that this is ludicrous. Some feel that this can be a first step - get
these credentials to get in the door and then you have three to five
years to really learn your subject and craft. I&amp;#39;m good with that but I
have a problem with anyone who says &amp;#34;you take it you teach it&amp;#34; is good
enough and I&amp;#39;ve heard of a number of regions that are seriously
considering it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why is this so bad and, I&amp;#39;d argue, dangerous? Not merely because we&amp;#39;ll
end up with substandard CS teachers for the foreseeable future but
also because it undermines the teaching profession as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s no secret that public education is under attack. A number of
states including Wisconsin, Arizona, Oklahoma, New York and Michigan
have considered relaxing the standards to become a teacher to address
a teacher shortage. In their twisted logic, the politicians and
&amp;#34;reformers&amp;#34; say that we can&amp;#39;t find enough qualified teachers because
we&amp;#39;ve made it an untenable career so let&amp;#39;s lower standards. You can
argue that any current state&amp;#39;s requirements are overly cumbersome but
that&amp;#39;s another conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When CS Educators say that all that&amp;#39;s needed to teach CS is to sit in
on a two week APCS institute is saying that to teach any subject you
don&amp;#39;t need content expertise. This is dangerous to education as a
whole and when power players in the CS Ed movement don&amp;#39;t speak up
otherwise or even worse that the stance that &amp;#34;you take it you teach
it&amp;#34; is OK, we&amp;#39;re undermining teaching as a profession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We need our heavy hitters to publicly and privately say that we need a
short term entry into the profession but we absolutely need plans and
pathways so that at the end of the day we have the best prepared
teachers in our schools for CS and for all subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another issue is when as CS Educators we don&amp;#39;t pay attention to the
whole child. I was at a meeting of CSTA people  from about thirty
states a few years ago. Someone asked &amp;#34;how can we advocate for CS when
the school might use it as an excuse to get rid of music?&amp;#34; Cameron
Wilson, at the time a lobbyist for the ACM said something to the
effect of &amp;#34;I&amp;#39;m not concerned with other subjects, my concern is
getting CS into the schools.&amp;#34; I get it, he was employed to stump CS
but we have to remember that we&amp;#39;re only a piece of the puzzle. We want
a seat at the table but we have to make sure that the table is
populated with everyone needed to provide a great education for our
kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A final issue I&amp;#39;ll mention here is how so many CS educators are so
close to the College Board. It was very disturbing that so many CS Ed
players were pushing for more students to take the APCS exam. Not the
class, not some other CS class but the APCS exam. AP is an extremely
controversial subject among teachers and many of us feel that too many
kids take too many AP classes and certainly too many exams. Remember,
the College Board is the organization that pushes things like the
PSAT8/9 another meaningless but high stakes exam inflicted upon our
kids at taxpayer expense. I understand that AP makes things easy -
they have courses, curricula, etc. but we&amp;#39;ve given the college board
an outsized influence on CS education and we&amp;#39;re not paying attention
to their outsized influence on education in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m just a small time teacher. I don&amp;#39;t have a national voice. I&amp;#39;m
urging those that do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look into what&amp;#39;s going on in greater education. Look at the way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;public education has been under attack and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at the side affects of our choices - who we partner with and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what policies we push.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We might not agree on the right path but everyone with a voice in CS
Education should be having hard conversations about this and then
strongly advocating for the positions they feel correct.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Self Certification - not a good idea</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/dont-self-certify/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/dont-self-certify/</guid>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;
You&amp;#39;ve probably seen an image like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/dont-self-certify/self-signed.png&#34; alt=&#34;/img/dont-self-certify/self-signed.png&#34; title=&#34;/img/dont-self-certify/self-signed.png&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s what you see when you try to access a secure web site but the web
site itself certified itself as being secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When people see this on a professional site it sets off all manner of
red flags. We feel much more comfortable when go to a site and we
don&amp;#39;t see that error. When we see the secure green lock in the url bar
indicating that this site is certified through an external trusted
source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s take this a step further. If you needed surgery would you go to
a board certified surgeon or would you go to Dr. Nick Riviera or some
other &amp;#34;self certified&amp;#34; doctor? Likewise you wouldn&amp;#39;t want to be
represented in court by someone who hasn&amp;#39;t passed the bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We might not feel that these certification and licensing processes are
perfect but when we need the services of a doctor or lawyer, we&amp;#39;re
happy these gatekeepers exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So we should all be extremely concerned with today&amp;#39;s announcement that
the deal for mayoral control just brokered in NYC came with strings
attached and one of those strings looks to open the doors to give some
charter chains the ability to self certify their teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s a story on it in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2017/07/06/with-city-charters-poised-to-win-certification-deal-education-schools-fret-113243&#34;&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt; and one in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/ny/2017/07/06/some-charter-school-teachers-could-become-certified-without-a-masters-under-proposed-new-suny-rules/&#34;&gt;Chalkbeat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One might think that some requirements to become a teacher are
ridiculous. I&amp;#39;ll get to them later  but this is really giving the fox
the keys to the henhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Charters appear to have extremely high rates of teacher attrition so
it makes sense that they want to control their teacher pipeline. This
alone should be a red flag against self certification but what else
are charter chains known for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misleading stats - claiming amazing passing numbers on standardized&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exams while neglecting to mention that somehow or other big blocks
of students were removed from the school prior to the test year
(&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shankerinstitute.org/blog/student-attrition-and-backfilling-success-academy-charter-schools-what-student-enrollment&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gotta go list&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forcing high levels of parent involvement (tough for single working&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;parents)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charging &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/education/article/KIPP-schools-collected-millions-in-unallowable-11257006.php&#34;&gt;illegal fees&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top this off with as taking resources from public schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Charters operate in anything but a transparent manner and we&amp;#39;re
expected to trust them to prepare &amp;#34;highly effective&amp;#34; teachers? I don&amp;#39;t
think so. Since there is no real accountability for charter schools -
they can easily game the system through student attrition, selective
admissions (by putting up barriers to enter the lottery) and test prep
they can pay lip service to teacher preparation and the public will be
none the wiser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we had a reasonable way of holding principals accountable and no,
test scores are not the answer then we could pretty much do away
with teacher certification. If principals were held to task to run an
effective school, something we can easily define but not measure, then
they would have every incentive to hire the best
teachers. Unfortunately we&amp;#39;re nowhere near that place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since we&amp;#39;re not, we&amp;#39;re left with the current systems of teacher
certification that has it&amp;#39;s own slew of problems. A big part of it, in
my opinion is that schools of education have lost the high
ground. While there are some institutions doing great work, reputation
wise, schools of education are held in very low regard. Strong
teachers trade stories of the watered down content classes and waste
of time classes where professors share their pet theories of
education. I can&amp;#39;t tell you how many times I&amp;#39;ve heard the new
definitive way to teach. At the same time, education research is
frequently held in low regard by teachers and the general public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the one hand we have charters run by and support by non-educators
wanting us to trust them and on the other we have institutions that
are questioned by the teachers they produce and the general public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t know the answer. I&amp;#39;m working on teacher certifications
programs at Hunter and it&amp;#39;s a balancing act. How much content is
sufficient and how much is too much. Can any of the general content be
streamlined or is it all necessary. If it isn&amp;#39;t necessary do we need
it anyway to satisfy the bean counters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you don&amp;#39;t have enough then we&amp;#39;re sending unprepared teachers into
the classroom. Too much and we&amp;#39;ll drive potential teachers away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As computer science education is defining itself we see similar
struggles. We have some people advocating certifications analogous to
existing teacher certifications. On the other extreme we have
advocates for two weeks summer training and you&amp;#39;re a CS teacher. I&amp;#39;d
like to think that I&amp;#39;m advocating for the sweet spot. Strong content
knowledge not tied to a specific course and matching content related
pedagogy. Time will tell becomes the certification standard and time
will tell whose approach was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For now, it&amp;#39;s important not to give away the store. Private charter
schools should not be the driving force behind teacher certification
and they certainly shouldn&amp;#39;t be allowed to train their own teachers
and then &amp;#39;teach&amp;#39; our students without much greater scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Addendum:
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m sure some of my friends will point out that private schools aren&amp;#39;t
held to any particular standard for teacher certification. This is
true but private schools don&amp;#39;t take public funds. Actually they do but
in my opinion, they shouldn&amp;#39;t. I maintain that charter schools are
publicly funded private schools in that they take public money but
operate as private entities. As such they should be held under the
greatest of scrutiny and standards – they aren&amp;#39;t&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>CS Teachers - teacher first or content first</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/teacher-to-cs-or-cs-to-teacher/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/teacher-to-cs-or-cs-to-teacher/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Is it easier to take CS people and teach them to teach or is it easier
to take teachers and teach them CS?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The question gets batted around from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This time via twitter:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Some think it&amp;#39;s easier to teach a teacher to teach CS than to teach a CS pro to teach. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/alfredtwo&#34;&gt;@alfredtwo&lt;/a&gt; is not one of them &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/QCUP8d8llZ&#34;&gt;https://t.co/QCUP8d8llZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Diane Levitt (@diane_levitt) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/diane_levitt/status/881874056911388673&#34;&gt;July 3, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Agreed. It takes a lot of work. More than a week long workshop.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Alfred Thompson (@alfredtwo) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/alfredtwo/status/882243591090962432&#34;&gt;July 4, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34;
charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The conversation was referring to blog posts by &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.acthompson.net/2017/06/become-computer-science-teacher-in-five.html?spref=tw&amp;amp;m=1&#34;&gt;Alfred Thompson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://gflint.wordpress.com/2017/06/20/a-week-of-in-service-another-python-course/&#34;&gt;Garth flint&lt;/a&gt;.
Alfred&amp;#39;s key point - one that I&amp;#39;ve spoken about before is that short
term professional development does not a CS teacher make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As to the lead in question? I&amp;#39;ve seen both routes succeed and both
routes fail. Both can be heavy lifts but there&amp;#39;s a missing part of the
equation that&amp;#39;s never addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The claim is that it&amp;#39;s easier to teach CS to a non-CS teacher because
they already know how to teach. The problem is, particularly in the
later grades that teachers of different subject areas have very
different tool sets. Sure, there are common factors – get the kids
involved, layer, spiral, etc. but you don&amp;#39;t teach a CS lesson the same
way you teach a math lesson let alone a literature, history, language
lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In a math class, it&amp;#39;s common to have students write solutions to
problems up on the board. If you try that in a CS class, you&amp;#39;ll be
waiting 20 minutes while the kids transcribe the problems. Likewise,
math homework will likely consist of a certain amount of repetitive
practice problems whereas a CS class won&amp;#39;t have something directly
analogous. This is not to say that you don&amp;#39;t have opportunities for
students to present at the board in CS class or that there isn&amp;#39;t
worthwhile homework but rather that even at this simple level, there
are differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, if we&amp;#39;re going to teach a non-CS teacher the CS content, beyond
the challenge of giving them the necessary depth and breadth of
content knowledge we have to teach them how to teach CS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve inventoried some of the techniques my colleagues and I have used
in our classes and the collected methods could easily fill a couple of
graduate education courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, what&amp;#39;s the answer to the question? It doesn&amp;#39;t matter where you
start but if we want to do right by our kids we need to prepare them
in not two but three areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CS Content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CS Pedagogy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General education and pedagogy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short term PD (professional development) won&amp;#39;t do it and neither will
scripts for &amp;#34;teachers&amp;#34; to follow. It&amp;#39;s going to take time, will, and
effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s hoping that municipalities look at the long game. It&amp;#39;s fine to
do PD now to get something started but it&amp;#39;s not enough. I wanted my
kids math teachers to know math and how to teach it. We should demand
no less from our CS teachers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Retaining Teachers</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/on-retaining-teachers/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/on-retaining-teachers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Back in February, I shared my thoughts on &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/will-we-lose-cs-teachers-to-industry&#34;&gt;losing CS teachers to the
tech industy&lt;/a&gt;. TL;DR - I don&amp;#39;t think it will be a CS Ed problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That said, I do think that it will be hard to find good CS teachers
but the reason is because it will get harder and harder to find good
teachers in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are plenty of reasons why it&amp;#39;s harder to become a
career teacher but I don&amp;#39;t want to talk about those today. There are
also plenty of powerful forces working to destroy public schools and
teaching as a career but this post isn&amp;#39;t about that either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This post is my attempt to tell people what teachers are actually
looking for. Some people assert that merit pay or similar &amp;#34;real world&amp;#34;
incentives will keep good teachers teaching but teachers are a
different breed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, I can&amp;#39;t speak for all teachers but I can talk about myself
and teachers I&amp;#39;ve known and worked with over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I never thought I&amp;#39;d be a teacher, it was just something I tried when I
was dissatisfied with Wall Street. I tried it, it stuck. I didn&amp;#39;t feel
at the time that teaching was my calling but somehow or other, I made
a career of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To start, schools are not factories, companies, stores, or any other
type of business. Teachers spend most of their days with students and
little time with each other. Most of their time is allocated for
them. A high school teacher in NY will likely teach 5 class of 34 kids
each, have 1 period for lunch, 1 for preparation and 1 assigned to
some school task. You probably won&amp;#39;t see your supervisor much. Mostly
at monthly meetings and when they observe you. Observations are
ostensibly for teacher evaluation and improvement but the system is
does neither well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Teachers also don&amp;#39;t have the same types of career paths as a other
professionals do. If you want to remain a classroom teacher, there is
no career path. You could become an assistant principal or principal
but those opportunities take you away from the kids and from your
subject area. They say teaching is a calling and for career classroom
teachers it probably is. For those who spent a few years in a
classroom and left for what they see as greener pastures, maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So instead teachers make a career by honing their craft, creating electives,
working with clubs and teams, or doing something similar that doesn&amp;#39;t
remove them from the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In my case, I developed some electives and one thing led to another
and I ended up where I am today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The career situation of the teacher is why things like merit pay never
work. As a teacher, I want, in fact need my colleagues to do well. I
might have your kids next year and if you do a poor job I&amp;#39;ll end up
suffering with the results. Sure, I&amp;#39;d like to be recognized as one of
the better teachers but it&amp;#39;s not healthy for my students, my school,
or my career if I&amp;#39;m pitted against my fellow teacher. We&amp;#39;re all in
this together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Teachers do accept merit pay when it&amp;#39;s forced on them though. As a
friend of mine once said - it&amp;#39;s like the teacher lottery - the way
they assign the merit bonuses are based on those bogus state exams so
the distribution is pretty random, one year I&amp;#39;ll get it, another year
someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is not to say that teachers couldn&amp;#39;t use a higher salary but even
then, teachers are not driven by the same motivations as business
people. I don&amp;#39;t know of any teacher who feels that they&amp;#39;d work harder
for more pay or that they work any less hard if they&amp;#39;re paid less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Teachers work and fight for their kids because that&amp;#39;s what we
do. Right before I left Stuy for Hunter, the teachers and city agreed
to a new contract. All of a sudden I got a pay raise. I can tell you
that I was neither a better or worse of a teacher the day after the
contract went into affect than the day before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My mentor and friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-11-07-rich-rich.html&#34;&gt;Richard Rothenberg&lt;/a&gt; talked to me about the deal we
make with society as teachers early in my career. He said, once you
get a few years in and have some seniority you&amp;#39;re pretty secure and
you&amp;#39;re only worry has to be teaching. We don&amp;#39;t do great in the good
times but we do OK. On the other hand, we still have jobs in the bad
times although, again, we don&amp;#39;t do great. We put in a lifetime of
service knowing that we won&amp;#39;t get any significant financial reward but
at the end of the day between our contributions and the city/state&amp;#39;s
investments we&amp;#39;ll get a pension and won&amp;#39;t be out in the cold in our
retirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The point is that those of us meant to be teachers were never looking
for the fast track to the upper class. We work to make a difference
and want society to enable us to make that difference. Teachers don&amp;#39;t
have to be paid like they are in &amp;#34;the real world&amp;#34; but they do need to
put a roof over their heads, send their kids to college and have a
vacation now and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s not too much to ask but in this day and age it&amp;#39;s apparently too
much to give.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mayoral Control - only when your guy&#39;s the mayor</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/mayoral-control/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/mayoral-control/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The hot debate this past week in NY Education circles is Mayoral
Control. When I started teaching, New York City schools were
controlled by the Board of Education. The board appointed a
chancellor. The system was supposed to balance community control as
well as some centralized decision making. The system was created in
the late 60s and was entrenched through my schooling. By the time I
was a teacher I think it was pretty much a given that the system
didn&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 2002, everything changed with Mayoral control under Michael
Bloomberg. Under mayoral control, the mayor appoints the chancellor
who appoints superintendents an on down the line. This was supposed to
create a chain of accountability leading up to and including the
mayor. To address concerns that parents voices would be heard, we had
the Panel for Educational Policy or PEP which was supposed to vet and
vote on policy and initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sounds good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, it was all a farce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Parents may or may not have had a voice under the old system but they
certainly didn&amp;#39;t have a voice with mayoral control. The majority of
members of the panel were mayoral appointees and if they didn&amp;#39;t vote
100% in line with their masters wishes, they were removed for someone
who would. Schools were closed and initiatives were passed that were
wildly unpopular with parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What did we get under mayoral control? There was some good, but we
also got:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;100% buy in to the pet education theories of non-educators like Bill&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School leaders who barely taught and had little experience as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;educators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Destruction of neighborhood schools&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Destruction of just about all of the large comprehensive high schools&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open doors for private charter schools that follow questionable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flawed (at best)  school and teacher evaluation models&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ATR pool&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, reformers - those out to privatize education loved mayoral
control under Bloomberg. It destabilized teaching as a career&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Did results improve?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some would say yes but it&amp;#39;s debatable. Graduation rates and test
scores are controlled by the politicians. When you have tests made,
graded, and curved in secret (except for those charter schools that
are exempt or grade their own tests), you&amp;#39;ve got to question any gains
or losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Bloomberg&amp;#39;s failing was (and possibly still is) that he and his
appointees didn&amp;#39;t understand education or teachers. Education not a
business and can&amp;#39;t be treated the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Did this help with accountability? To quote Mr. Bloomberg: &amp;#34;They can
boo me at parades.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fast forward to the de Blasio administration. Personally, I was not a
fan of Bloomberg&amp;#39;s educational policy and I also feel that de Blasio&amp;#39;s
also doing a poor job. Regardless of my opinion, Mayoral control under
de Blasio has certainly felt more community friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This hasn&amp;#39;t sat well with the reformers upstate and while Michael
Bloomberg was granted mayoral control for his entire term, Bill de
Blasio has had to fight for it every year and every year control has
come with strings attached – generally involving the flow of money
into private charter schools - still with questionable practices and
results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The funny thing is that many of those saying mayoral control was bad
during the Bloomberg era say it&amp;#39;s a necessity now  and many against it
under Bloomberg are fans under de Blasio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What&amp;#39;s even funnier, in a tragic way is that it isn&amp;#39;t really even
control. So much is really controlled in Albany under Governor
Cuomo. When de Blasio wanted to charge private charters for space
(rightfully so, in my opinion), Albany stepped in and gave the
charters a free pass. How is that mayoral control?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Regardless of your political leanings, it&amp;#39;s pretty clear that mayoral
control is only a good thing when the mayor is your guy. We need
something brand new that supports our communities. I was at the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://personaldemocracy.com/conference&#34;&gt;Personal Democracy Forum 2017&lt;/a&gt; a couple of weeks ago and a recurring
theme, one which we really need now for our schools is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;build with, not for&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we don&amp;#39;t get there we&amp;#39;ll be stuck booing our politicians at parades.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Will we lose CS teachers to industry?</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/draft-will-we-lose-cs-teachers-to-industry/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/draft-will-we-lose-cs-teachers-to-industry/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we properly prepare CS teachers, won&amp;#39;t they just jump ship and take
tech industry jobs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I hear that a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tech pays big. Teaching? Not so much. Tech workers are respected and
have flexible jobs. Teaching? Again, not so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Those chanting these refrains advocate the current simple teacher
&amp;#34;training&amp;#34; - scripted lessons, minimal pedagogical content knowledge,
even less real content knowledge. That  will keep them in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They&amp;#39;re wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
People fearing an exodus of prepared CS teachers don&amp;#39;t get
education. True, many young CS teachers will leave the profession but
that&amp;#39;s because &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;many young teachers leave the profession&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Why do young
teachers leave? Regardless of subject area some of the reasons are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s much harder than everyone thinks it is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low pay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lack of respect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overworked&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lack of autonomy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being scapegoated for poverty&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s become about testing, not teaching&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these are unique to computer science teachers so the argument
that CS teachers who know too much will leave is really saying, &amp;#34;we
have to keep our teachers dumb enough to stay - make sure they don&amp;#39;t
have outside options&amp;#34; rather than &amp;#34;let&amp;#39;s make teaching a desirable
profession to be in.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, this is bred from a lack of understanding about what drives
teachers. It&amp;#39;s typical of politicians and business leaders and short
term temps like TFAers who came in for a cup of coffee and now know
how to solve the education problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Teacher don&amp;#39;t become teachers to
get rich or to do better than the other guy – I know I didn&amp;#39;t. We
enter it to do good - to uplift the have nots. This is why business
models like stack ranking and bonus or merit pay just don&amp;#39;t work. A
school is a team and we&amp;#39;re all in it together. Our job is to take care
of our kids, not to be better than that other guy. We wish we had more
time to work together and to improve things for our entire population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back to computer science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My contention is that you might lose some teachers to industry but
they either weren&amp;#39;t meant to be teachers anyway or they couldn&amp;#39;t
afford to be teachers or the system beat them down. None of these are
reasons not to properly prepare them. Besides, all teachers in all
subject areas could work their way into an entry level tech job via a
summer coding boot camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We can also look to the past to allay concerns. While it&amp;#39;s true that
for hiring purposes, English teachers are a dime a dozen and
candidates typically
have fewer outside options (although great English teachers are harder
to find), Math and Science teachers generally have options. I know
many top Math and Science teachers who could easily get non teaching
jobs - the Math teachers in finance the science, certainly in
pharmaceutical companies over in NJ. These options exist yet we manage
to populate our classes with teachers. True, it&amp;#39;s difficult at times,
particularly in Physics, but these are due to the lack of respect
teaching gets as a profession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we prepare CS teachers properly, yes, we&amp;#39;ll lose some, but we&amp;#39;ll
keep the ones we&amp;#39;re supposed to or if we lose them it will be due to
other factors. Additionally, by having proper CS teacher
preparation programs, we&amp;#39;ll also provide an entry path to those people
meant to be teachers but prior had no way of getting in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a nation, we&amp;#39;re moving away from prepared, knowledgeable teachers
and towards drill-masters. Let&amp;#39;s not let CS Education go the way of
all ed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Should CS Ed be in bed with the College Board</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cs-ed-in-bed-college-board/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cs-ed-in-bed-college-board/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m guessing my views  on this aren&amp;#39;t very popular -that&amp;#39;s OK, every
community needs a curmudgeon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A few years ago, I cautioned if we weren&amp;#39;t careful, once the big
players got involved, CS Ed would go the way of other disciplines, and
not in a good way. It looks like indeed we&amp;#39;re well on our way down
that road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve ranted before about things like non-profits, drop in and summer
programs. &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-05-07-learning-takes-time.html/#.WJXSS99vHmE&#34;&gt;STEM Oil Salesmen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-reference&#34;&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;footnote-reference-1&#34; href=&#34;#footnote-1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
selling easy fixes, exciting kids and parents, using the Think Method
just like Professor Harold Hill only to send the kids off where they
can blame a future teacher for failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve also ranted about teacher preparation and how all the rage is
short term, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/scotland/#.WJXT999vHmE&#34;&gt;Superficial PD and scripted curricula&lt;/a&gt;  and my concern that
once the politicians can say CS is in the schools, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-03-04-expedient-vs-good.html/#.WJXT7d9vHmE&#34;&gt;we&amp;#39;ll be done&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been working towards getting CS to all students for most of my
career and while it&amp;#39;s wonderful to see us getting closer to the goal,
I&amp;#39;m seeing more and more signs that my caution is becoming
reality. and CS Ed is going the way of other Ed - aligned to testing
and more to the whims of the power players and politicians than to
teachers and students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The other week I noticed, &lt;a href=&#34;http://teacherblog.code.org/post/156278055294/ap-cs-principles-could-make-history-how-can-we&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; by Code.org trying to encourage
more students to take the APCSP exam - not encourage more students
take the class or some other class or to have more students be exposed
to CS but to actually sit for the APCSP exam. That post was followed
by &lt;a href=&#34;http://teacherblog.code.org/post/156689658029/ask-your-cs-principles-students-to-star-in-our&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; which also highlights actually taking the exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This didn&amp;#39;t sit well with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What does the exam do for the kid? It doesn&amp;#39;t drive instruction - by
that time, any good teacher knows their student and is better served
by using their own &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ap-we-dont-trust-teachers/#.WJXbA99vHmE&#34;&gt;assessments&lt;/a&gt;. The college credit thing? I&amp;#39;m
skeptical. Fewer and fewer schools are giving credit for APCSA let
alone this new CS0 non major course. Blanket credit? Since full time
students pay for a range of credits, I&amp;#39;m still skeptical
here. Placement? It&amp;#39;s a course for non-majors - what exactly are you
placing out of?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Reasons not to take the exam?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it doesn&amp;#39;t do anything for the kid, why take it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stress of taking the exam&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other ways of placing out of courses once in college&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save the expense&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a general rule, I&amp;#39;m against forcing students to sit for
AP exams. At the extreme case, since we&amp;#39;ve been brainwashed to think
that a school that has lots of kids sitting for exams is good, I&amp;#39;ve
seen at least one case of a principal having all his kids sit for, and
just about all &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fail&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; AP Calculus - that is, get a 1 or 2 on the exam. This
principal had all his students take the exam, and only 2 scores were 3
or higher. This principal then parlayed his success into a higher
profile gig - he&amp;#39;s moved up in the world while setting up his students
to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This follows last year&amp;#39;s announcement that code.org was &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-05-19-code-org-college-board.html/#.WJXbm99vHmE&#34;&gt;partnering with
the College Board&lt;/a&gt; - offering PD to teachers for free if the schools
signed up their students for the PSAT 8/9 - another meaningless
exam. So, we get teacher training light [fn::If you think that PD based
teacher training is OK, ask yourself if you want your own child&amp;#39;s
chemistry teacher to be a history teacher with a few weeks summer
training in chemistry] as long as the school pays for
the PSAT8/9 for every kid so that the kid can take yet another test
with really no value[fn::And I&amp;#39;m guessing the exam will be offered
during the day so teachers will proctor for free rather than be
allowed to, you know, teach their students.].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why should students pay for an AP exam that doesn&amp;#39;t do anything for
them? Why should Jane Q Taxpayer pay for exams that only server to
enrich the College Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
True, The College Board is a big player. They already have much more
influence of American High School education than they should. It&amp;#39;s
easy to climb on board the AP train for entre into our schools. The
question is, should we use positions of influence to push efforts that
might help our end but leave collateral damage to students and the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t doubt code.org&amp;#39;s sincerity in wanting good CS in all schools
nor the efforts or value as an advocate for CS Education. I&amp;#39;m
concerned that the desire to win big and win now is moving us in a
direction that we&amp;#39;ll regret years from now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>It&#39;s not one issue, it&#39;s the President and his enablers</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/trump-issues/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/trump-issues/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Like many of my fellow bloggers and tweeters, I generally keep this
site clear of political issues with the exception of those that are
directly related to education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, like many of my fellow bloggers and tweeters, this week has
provided a reason to break with that tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many people, including some friends, all more eloquent than I have
already posted, tweeted, and Facebooked  about the behavior of our
President and government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Long time blogger &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/davewiner&#34;&gt;Dave Winer&lt;/a&gt; put together &lt;a href=&#34;http://trumpstatus.org/&#34;&gt;trumpstatus.org&lt;/a&gt; where he&amp;#39;s
collecting many of the issues that we&amp;#39;re all so alarmed with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I would add cabinet appointments to his list with my particular
personal concern over DeVos and the department of education. I&amp;#39;ve been
meaning to blog about that for a while - perhaps this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My concern for today is something else. Every day, I see a new Trump
induced crisis and every day I see a different subset of my circles
respond. It&amp;#39;s not quite as bad as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Socialist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Trade Unionist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Jew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
People are indeed speaking out, but I am concerned that people
are going to rise up for their personal issue and when placated go
back to business as usual - this is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the time for business as
usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With the ACA repeal, I saw concerns from my working class friends and
friends that work with lower earning populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Going into the DeVos hearing, mostly educators - real educators not
astroturf reformers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With Friday&amp;#39;s order, the whole tech community came out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s part of a thread by tech activist &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/anildash&#34;&gt;Anil Dash&lt;/a&gt; calling out,
calling on, and crediting assorted tech players.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;When net neutrality was the issue, Google, Twitter, Wikipedia, Reddit, Tumblr, etc. had a blackout, and it worked. This is far more grave.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Anil Dash (@anildash) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/anildash/status/825414889908928517&#34;&gt;January 28, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;A powerful, straightforward statement from the CEO of Box — another publicly-traded company. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/wz5mQmTh6P&#34;&gt;https://t.co/wz5mQmTh6P&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Anil Dash (@anildash) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/anildash/status/825470308463280130&#34;&gt;January 28, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We have to remember that all these order, policies, appointments, and
plans are coming from the same place - Donald Trump and those
politicians that are enabling him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If he backs off on immigration, education issues remain, if he backs
off there, we still have ACA, if that eases up, what about Women&amp;#39;s
rights and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This means we all have to get involved and stay involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What have I been doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally joined the ACLU and set up a monthly donation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I subscribed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://dailyaction.org&#34;&gt;Daily Action&lt;/a&gt; so that I get a reminder each day of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;someone I can call to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m starting to accumulate my representatives phone numbers as I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;make those calls and am trying to make at least a call a day to
remind our representatives who they work for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education and advocacy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And if you suggestions for me - please post them here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thus ends my not business as usual post. What&amp;#39;s going on in America is
not someone else&amp;#39;s problem - it&amp;#39;s all of our problem and we all have
to be active and vigilant to make it through tough times to come.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Selling out or getting a seat at the table</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/selling-out-or-a-seat-at-the-table/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/selling-out-or-a-seat-at-the-table/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The other day, a friend posited a question on Facebook (paraphrased):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If called upon, would you take a job in an administration who&amp;#39;s policies you strongly
disagreed with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Would you go work for an administration that you reviled in order to
get a seat at the table? To try to affect change from the inside or
would you consider yourself a sellout or worse, publicly promote
positions you disagree with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tough question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The original question implied national level positions. I&amp;#39;ve never and
will never breath such rarefied air but I have had such experiences
closer to ground level, both with DOE projects and also in
conversations with some charter chains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My take?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyone that knows me knows that I&amp;#39;ve had various dealings with the NYC
DOE and also knows that those dealings never resulted in outcomes I
was happy with. Over my time at Stuy, I had many philosophical
differences with Tweed (a common nickname for the NYC DOE as they&amp;#39;re
housed in the old Tweed courthouse) and these were times where I tried
to play nice to have a seat at the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Once I was at a meeting that also included a number of tech industry
heavy hitters. After the meeting, one came over to me. He knew me
by having worked with my former students. I knew him by reputation. He
asked &amp;#34;do they really want our thoughts on this or are we just here so
that they can do what they wanted in the first place and then parade us out
to say that they consulted experts in the tech industry?&amp;#34; I honestly
didn&amp;#39;t know at the time but I had my doubts as to the DOE&amp;#39;s sincerity
in being open to either my views or this CTO&amp;#39;s As it turned out, they
just did want to parade us. Later in the process, I was told in a back
room that it would be wise of me not to publicly voice my thoughts
about the direction of one particular project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So there you have it. I was given a seat at the table but only as long
as my views mirrored the views of those in power. Not really much of a
seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve also sat down with some charter chains - chains that I&amp;#39;ve been
more than happy to denounce publicly. Why did I take the meetings?
Mostly to find out if I was mistaken in my position and if so, maybe
I could help them. Every time I&amp;#39;ve had such a meeting, however, I&amp;#39;ve
left the table with my feelings unchanged and knowing that I would
never willingly help them as I felt their practices were harmful to
kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In one case, I took the seat but failed to affect change. In the other
I refused the seat. I&amp;#39;ll always take a meeting and I&amp;#39;ll always work
with someone who wants to help kids and who has an open mind but I&amp;#39;ve
found that the more powerful the player, at least in education, the
more likely they are to just want confirmation of their own bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You might get a seat at the table but you also might end up lending
your reputation to a cause you don&amp;#39;t believe in.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Evaluate teachers like they do in the real world</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/evaluating-teachers/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 19 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/evaluating-teachers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
This old article has been reposted a few times in my circles over the
past few weeks &lt;a href=&#34;http://educationnext.org/facadeofexcellence/.&#34;&gt;http://educationnext.org/facadeofexcellence/.&lt;/a&gt; It&amp;#39;s from
2003 and complains about the lack of flexibility schools had back then
with regard to hiring and salary. The article is old and out of date
and the seniority system no longer holds for hiring but it does for
lay offs. The salary scale from back then, though, is still in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My friend Alex  asked my thought about how we might deal with evaluating
teacher quality. I thought I&amp;#39;d share them here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Alex listed a number of commonly tried and suggested options on
teacher evaluation and why they&amp;#39;re all flawed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I haven&amp;#39;t asked Alex&amp;#39;s permission so I won&amp;#39;t post his list and
comments here. Instead let&amp;#39;s start with the boogeyman those that attack public
education always trot out – tenure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s get a couple of things straight - tenure is not a job for
life. For K12 teachers, it&amp;#39;s the right to due process. That means you
can&amp;#39;t be fired without cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I hear the free market capitalists out there already – &amp;#34;in the real
world, you&amp;#39;re an at will employee, why do teachers need this due
process?&amp;#34; - I&amp;#39;ll get to that down below. For now, let&amp;#39;s look at a few
points on tenure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First - you can fire a tenured teacher, you just have to document your
case. This means that the supervisor has to actually do their job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next - people can complain about rubber rooms and the time it takes to
fire one of these tenured teachers. That&amp;#39;s because the DOE won&amp;#39;t hire
sufficient hearing officers. In a recently resolved case, a friend of
mine - a terrific AP was finally returned to her post after she was
railroaded on false charges. She was in the rubber room for years. The
DOE kept delaying the process – all she wanted was to go to &amp;#34;trial&amp;#34;
since everyone knew she&amp;#39;d be exonerated - the fact that she was up on
charges at all speaks to why teachers need tenure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next - teachers don&amp;#39;t grant tenure, the administration does. Why are
all these horrible teachers being granted tenure? Stories abound of
administrators granting tenure to bad teachers so long as they
transfer to another school - who&amp;#39;s to blame here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, the contract that establishes tenure is jointly negotiated
by the teachers union and the city - no one ever seems to complain
about the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next, let&amp;#39;s talk about bonuses and competition. People in the business
world take the false assumption that everyone thinks, acts, and feels like
they do. Here&amp;#39;s a surprising fact – teachers aren&amp;#39;t in it for the
money. Sure, we&amp;#39;d like to make a little more - perhaps enough to
actually  live in a decent apartment and not need a second job to make
ends meet -  but no one went into teaching to get rich. Teachers are in
it to uplift ALL their students and their school as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now let&amp;#39;s look at the model currently in vogue - value added
measures. Besides the fact that they&amp;#39;re arbitrary and don&amp;#39;t work (see
&lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-09-06-why_i_might_no_longer_be_an_effective_teacher.md/&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-10-25-effective-teacher-2.md/&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;) they&amp;#39;re nothing like how people are evaluated
in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How are people evaluated in regular jobs? As far as I know, they&amp;#39;re
evaluated by their managers and bosses - possibly also by their peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Funny thing - that&amp;#39;s how teachers used to be evaluated before all this
nonsense brought about by the &amp;#34;reformers.&amp;#34; Of course, no one will
admit to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Did this system work? For the most part, but not entirely. Why were
there problems? Because, unlike a business, principals are not
necessarily incentivized to have the best teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Schools and principals are evaluated on ridiculous metrics - the same
standardized tests they use to evaluate teachers. To look at a small
piece – to graduate high school, kids need to pass at least one math
regents and pass three years of math classes. To be &amp;#34;college ready&amp;#34; a
student still only needs to pass one math regents and take at least
one year of geometry or trig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This means that as far as math is concerned, a principal is
incentivized to have a math department that can get their kids through
the algebra regents. Here&amp;#39;s how this frequently plays out. The kids
take algebra over two years and then passes the exam. The kids take
geometry as their third year. They don&amp;#39;t have to pass the regents, but
it appears that in order to increase a student&amp;#39;s chances of passing
that exam, classes don&amp;#39;t teach proof - the most important and hardest
part of the class. Why not? Because it&amp;#39;s easier to pass the exam by
learning most of the other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here we have a school where the incentive is to hire teachers that can
teach to the algebra regents and that&amp;#39;s about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That&amp;#39;s at a school with a low performing population. In a higher
performing school, the kids will do well on the standardized tests
regardless of teacher quality so there&amp;#39;s no incentive to hire the
best. Even if that&amp;#39;s what they want to do, there&amp;#39;s no way to know if
they&amp;#39;re actually doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back to why teachers need due process. Since principals aren&amp;#39;t held
accountable in any reasonable way, teachers can&amp;#39;t be. The end result
is that teachers are subject to abuses by principals. I myself was
once brought up on bogus charges raised by a principal (not a Stuy
one) who wanted to make trouble. Without due process, I would be out
of a job. So would many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The answer? To me it&amp;#39;s figure out how to hold principals
accountable. In Alex&amp;#39;s Facebook post he  mentions evaluation by
college and workforce success but that has a slow feedback loop. The
truth is, education does have a slow feedback loop. Schools, however,
exist for along time and principals should have tenure periods of more than
just a couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My feelings? Why not look at graduates succeeding in college or on the
tax rolls? This wouldn&amp;#39;t be perfect but it would be a start. While NY
can&amp;#39;t count on private universities sharing accurate information in a
timely manner there should be a way of tracking if a high school
graduate is enrolled in a SUNY or CUNY one, two, three, or four
semesters after graduation. Create a baseline for a school and start
from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If principals were actually accountable in a reasonable
way they&amp;#39;d have incentive to have the best teachers. Then we can get
back to the old system which was indeed the way the &amp;#34;real world&amp;#34;
works.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Hunter CS is so important to NYC</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/hunter-cs-important/</link>

      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/hunter-cs-important/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
If you know me you know that my morning reads include a visit over to
&lt;a href=&#34;http://avc.com&#34;&gt;avc.com&lt;/a&gt;, Today, &lt;a href=&#34;http://avc.com/2016/10/cranes/&#34;&gt;Fred&amp;#39;s post&lt;/a&gt; talked about development and progress,
evolution, if you would, in the city. Although not directly related,
it got me thinking about gentrification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To me, gentrification all too often seems to result in pushing out
people and business that were there during the hard times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We don&amp;#39;t need to force out long time residents that can no longer make
rent - we need to uplift communities with pathways to towards greater
economic opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Those of us in CS Education, each in our own way, are trying to help
build those pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Return readers know that I&amp;#39;ve ranted about some of the popular magic
bullets. I&amp;#39;ve periodically talked about my concerns over code schools
but even at their best they represent a workforce program for the well
to do. I&amp;#39;ve also talked about efforts like P-Tech which sound good,
but besides the fact that &lt;a href=&#34;https://garyrubinstein.wordpress.com/2016/10/06/p-tech-principal-responds/&#34;&gt;the emperor has no clothes&lt;/a&gt;, is the school
really preparing kids for opportunities in their own neighborhoods or
in data centers far from home?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are some workforce programs like &lt;a href=&#34;https://perscholas.org/&#34;&gt;Per Scholas&lt;/a&gt; that I really like
and respect but they&amp;#39;re limited in what they can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What does that leave us with? The traditional path – college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In terms of tech, New York City has some amazing colleges. You ask
most people, they&amp;#39;ll come back with NYU, Columbia. Great institutions
but &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; expensive.  Not everyone can afford $75,000 a year and
not everyone can afford to go into hundreds of thousands of debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is why Hunter CS is so important. Actually CUNY but I can only
affect my little corner of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hunter College has a really nice CS program and department. It&amp;#39;s small
and has flown under the radar but it&amp;#39;s one of the reasons I came over
to Hunter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of my responsibilities at Hunter is to develop our new honors CS
program and to connect all of  Hunter CS to the tech sector in NY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I haven&amp;#39;t written much about what&amp;#39;s been going on but that will change
int the months to come. Suffice it to say that to uplift our
communities we need real, affordable educational opportunities and in
terms of tech, education that leads to real opportunities in
our city&amp;#39;s tech sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m convinced that Hunter College can be a game changer for the wealth
of young talent we have in New York and for our tech sector.&lt;/p&gt;
