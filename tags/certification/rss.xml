      <title>If you build programs, teachers will come</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s been a month since my last post. In fact it seems that most of
the usual CS Ed bloggers are down in frequency this year. For me it&amp;#39;s
probably been Covid fatigue and the resulting funk but I&amp;#39;m going to
see if I can force myself to write more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, the other day someone was asking about CS certification in NY
state on Facebook. One comment caught my eye. It was about Michigan
dropping all requirements to teach CS because, and I&amp;#39;m paraphrasing
here, nobody who knows enough CS to go into industry will ever become
a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I both resent and resemble that remark as do a handful of my
colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve heard this argument many times. A particularly disgusting version
goes &amp;#34;if we teach CS teachers too much CS they&amp;#39;ll leave for industry.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t buy it. That&amp;#39;s just an excuse and it&amp;#39;ll keep our students from
getting the teachers they both need and deserve. Why don&amp;#39;t I buy it?
Math and Science. CS is the hot subject these days and, at least in
theory, with a strong tech background you can &amp;#34;easily&amp;#34; get a high
paying job but CS wasn&amp;#39;t always the be all and end all. There were and
are other fields that pay well and can pull from our pool of potential
teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s dig a little deeper. Nowadays you can become certified in math
or science in New York state by completing an &amp;#34;approved program,&amp;#34;
taking some state exams and jumping through a few hoops. This has led
programs in &amp;#34;math education.&amp;#34; Some of these  programs provide teachers
with a solid foundation in math but some, not so much. Back before no
child left behind, at least in New York City, you had to actually know
your math. You needed legit math credits as opposed to math-ed (which
can be legit or lame) and you had to get through the &amp;#34;board of
examiners&amp;#34; where you had to face a panel of teachers and assistant
principals who could grill you on all manner of content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Where am I going with this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Well, a math teacher who knows their math, at least in NY has plenty
of alternatives. Accounting has always been a mainstay but for the big
bucks we have wall street. How is it we have math teachers that know
math when wall street and those big bonuses beckon? Same thing with
some of the sciences - we&amp;#39;ve got big pharma right across the river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The truth is that some people are good in their subject area and
actually want to become teachers. This might not be the majority of CS
people, math people etc. but there are some. Math and science might be
shortage areas in schools over time but somehow schools manage to find
teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The problem with CS is that there was never a career path. If you knew
CS you couldn&amp;#39;t get certification so you had to go in through math or
some other subject. Then you had to find a school where you could
teach CS and of course, for seniority and job retention you were
always lumped in with another discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, a career path is developing. We&amp;#39;ve got programs like mine at
Hunter through which a prospective teacher can become certified and we
have schools starting to offer CS and they&amp;#39;ll want to hire those CS
teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;ll just take time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Our first Masters cohort at Hunter has four students in it. Our
second, which will start in the Fall looks like it will have
around 6. These are small but from what I&amp;#39;m told, pretty good sizes
for a new program, particularly when there was zero advertising and
outreach. I&amp;#39;ve also started to get questions from undergraduate CS
students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We&amp;#39;re not going to solve K12 CS education over night. We&amp;#39;ve got to play
the long game. Positions that need certified CS teachers are starting
to appear as are pathways to certification. There will be people who
want to teach and want to teach CS. If we give them the pathway they
will come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a final thought though, knowledgeable CS teachers do have a
choice. So do knowledgable math and science teachers. If they&amp;#39;re
leaving teaching or not even entering the profession it&amp;#39;s not because
of CS, math, or science. It&amp;#39;s because we&amp;#39;ve made teaching as a
profession so undesireable and those teachers have options. That&amp;#39;s why
I found that version of the argument I mentioned up at the top so
disgusting. People who don&amp;#39;t want CS teachers to know real CS are
really saying that the only way they can get and keep teachers is to
in fact keep them uneducated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New York City has Certified CS Teachers</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/certified-teachers/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m super proud to say that New York City now has state certified
Computer Science Teachers!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/cs-cert.png&#34; width=&#34;500px&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s been a long road - really long if you consider I got started on
my CS Ed journey decades ago and there&amp;#39;s a long road ahead but we hit
a major milestone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I started at Hunter a little over five years ago and creating teacher
certification programs was one of the goals. Back then, the state had
neither CS certification nor CS standards. The certification area was
created a year or so ago and the standards were just adopted this past
December. Hunter&amp;#39;s programs were approved December 2019 and we started
our first advanced certificate cohort last summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Twenty one working teachers, all certified in another subject
area. They spent a big chunk of their summer with us all day every day
and continued on with classes and field work in the Fall. Many
finished last December while a few needed one more course which
they&amp;#39;re taking now. Earlier today on our Slack, teachers from that
cohort started sharing that they either received their state
certificates in the mail or that they looked themselves up on the
NYSED web site and confirmed that they were now certified to teach
computer science in the state of NY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is big news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The entire cohort came in as strong teachers and they all grew
tremendously in terms of CS knowledge and their ability to teach
it. Now they represent the first of a growing group of certified CS
teachers - education leaders to provide a core of expertise in terms of
both CS content and how to teach it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m super proud of the cohort and super proud to be part of this. One
of the best parts for me have been meeting and working with these
great teachers and having this new learning network form - hopefully
we can keep it growing for years to come. Another is being able to get
the band back together - I was able to bring in my old partners in
crime JonAlf and Topher to teach and anyone who&amp;#39;s seen them teach know
that they&amp;#39;re the best. I couldn&amp;#39;t include our other co-conspirator,
Sam, because he was on sabbatical and couldn&amp;#39;t work but hopefully that
will change next time around. Not having a team at Hunter has been
really one of the few downsides so being able to work with my &amp;#34;go to
guys&amp;#34; again was a blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We also have our Masters program well underway so the pipeline of CS
teachers is starting to form. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is exciting news for New York City, Hunter and for me
personally. Long road ahead but as of today, a bunch of students in
NYC are being taught by state certified computer science teachers and
there will be more to come.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Physics Teacher Wanted - must NOT know Physics</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-creds/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 07 Feb 2021 19:00:53 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
There were a few posts over on Facebook this weekend about teacher
certification. It started with a question - should teacher
certification be based on an exam like APCS-A with the teacher
correctly answering 85% or greater. A lively discussion
followed. There was agreement and disagreement with responses ranging
from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;good idea&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&amp;#39;s too hard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&amp;#39;s not hard enough&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a discussion of the importance of content knowledge vs
knowing how to teach in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since there was a lot going on in the thread I thought I&amp;#39;d pull my own
thoughts out into this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s first look at the test. There are a number of states that have
a content test for computer science. For some states, I think it&amp;#39;s the
only requirement. In terms of content, at least the Praxis exam is
something like APCS-A on steroids. This is not a good thing. Don&amp;#39;t get
me wrong, I think a qualified CS teacher should know more than APCS-A
on steroids but a single day test is not how you measure deep content
knowledge. I know plenty of students who&amp;#39;ve passed standardized
exams - be they regents, AP, or other but they were no way qualified
to teach the course. They knew the formulas, recognized the patterns,
but didn&amp;#39;t really know the material. Is this what we want of our CS
teachers? I certainly don&amp;#39;t. I&amp;#39;m not hugely opposed to an exam
covering somethign like college CS1 content other than my general
anti-testing beliefs - it would help to curtail some of the problems
that will invariably arise with weak certification programs but it
should no way be the actual bar to teach - if it exists, it should be
just one standard measure along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now to that content vs pedagogy thing. What current teachers and in
fact most people in the CS Ed space forget is that states move slowly
and that we&amp;#39;re playing the long game. Right now most CS teachers are
converts from other disciplines and relatively few have strong CS
backgrounds but over time this will change. As CS becomes more
established we&amp;#39;ll have young teachers entering the filed with the
intent of becoming a CS teacher. If states and teacher prep programs
set the content bar low that&amp;#39;ll be what we&amp;#39;re stuck with for a LONG
time.  We wouldn&amp;#39;t dream of creating a science teacher credential
where the teacher hardly knows any science - no way should we do it
for CS or any other subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The truth is that we need teacher prep programs that ensure that new
CS teachers know both the content and how to teach it and that content
should not be tied in to any specific curriculum. I wrote more about
all of this &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teachers-prep-big-pic/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So what do do with current teachers and current needs? Easy - give
them time. Back when I started teaching I was a career changer. I
never took an education course, never student taught, nothing. Turns
out that Math was a shortage area so I had an option - as long as I
had enough math credits I&amp;#39;d get a temporary license  and start
teaching. Instead of teaching 5 classes, I&amp;#39;d teach 4 and get a
mentor. I then had to get a certain number of education credits within
a certain period of time. Since I already had the subject credits it
was just about learning how to teach. Truth is, I barely survived that
first year but things did get better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
New York and other states probably couldn&amp;#39;t do the exact same
thing. First off, current and potential teachers might not know the
content so it wouldn&amp;#39;t just be ed courses and second, certification
rules have changed big time since NCLB. Still, they could do something
similar - approve certification programs like the one I created at
Hunter - ones designed for current non-CS teachers and give teachers a
period of time to complete it. For career changers, create CS version
of programs like the NY Teaching Fellows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What isn&amp;#39;t acceptable is saying that CS teachers don&amp;#39;t have to know CS
and that career changers who know CS don&amp;#39;t have to learn how to
teach. Create the programs and give people time. We&amp;#39;re playing the
long game and the only way we lose is if we cut corners for
convenience at the expense of the kids.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Strong K12 Teacher Certification is Important</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/strong-teacher-certification/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/strong-teacher-certification/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
About a week ago New York State&amp;#39;s new regulation creating a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20180327/NEWS/180329893/new-york-will-finally-have-certified-computer-science-teachers&#34;&gt;K12 CS
teacher certification&lt;/a&gt; went live. Just the other day I was honored to be
interviewed by  &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mflamm_reporter&#34;&gt;Matt Flamm&lt;/a&gt; of Crain&amp;#39;s New York in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20180410/TECHNOLOGY/180419999/asked-answered-teacher-changed-jobs-to-push-for-new-york-states-new&#34;&gt;follow up piece&lt;/a&gt;
about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Having K12 CS teacher certification is big and having quality programs
that lead to certification is &lt;strong&gt;HUGE&lt;/strong&gt;. In my view, it&amp;#39;s a game changer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s Focus on high school, my wheelhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From a course offerings point of view it&amp;#39;s the wild west. I don&amp;#39;t mean
this as a bad thing, it&amp;#39;s just that there&amp;#39;s a huge range of offerings
from AP to home brew, physical computing, game based, cyber security,
you name it, there&amp;#39;s a curriculum. The long and short of this is that
schools need teachers to teach all of these experiences. Without a
strong certification pathway we&amp;#39;re going to be stuck with the current
training based model where teachers are trained to deliver canned
curricula rather than truly teach. With strong teacher preparation
programs teachers will be prepared not only to deliver all the
existing curricula but, arguable more importantly design their own
learning experiences appropriate for the populations they work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is important and alone would make having CS certification
worthwhile but to me the BIG win is that it creates a viable career
path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
People say we&amp;#39;ll never find enough CS teachers because the tech
industry pays so well. I&amp;#39;ve never believed that. We find math teachers
even though many could flee to finance and chem teachers in spite of
big pharma&amp;#39;s call so why can&amp;#39;t we find CS teachers? Because we&amp;#39;ve
never provided a path into the profession and a viable career track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Certification means that over time schools will be able to build CS
teachers and the discipline will be treated as the other
subjects. Prior to certification, a CS teacher might be cut if a
school&amp;#39;s math department downsized. With certification, the career
track for a CS teacher is the same as the track for any other teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It also means that young people starting out who are interested in
both teaching and computer science will have a way of getting into the
profession - something that has never before existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Having CS certification alone won&amp;#39;t woo a
plethora of current tech professionals into teaching but over time,
we&amp;#39;ll start to have CS Ed majors or CS majors pursuing CS ED Masters
degrees and entering the profession. This won&amp;#39;t happen in a press or
election cycle but it will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This all hinges on quality prep programs. I think I&amp;#39;ve hit the sweet
spot with what I&amp;#39;ve designed at Hunter. The critical components are of
course content and pedagogy. Teacher candidates must have both
sufficient depth and breadth in the subject and all the pedagogical
content knowledge that comes along with it. I don&amp;#39;t agree with the
common approach of taking a course to teach a course - that is, having
courses like &amp;#34;APCS - Principles for teachers&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;APCS - A for
teachers.&amp;#34;  I want my teachers to be able to teach any reasonable
curriculum or design their own so we&amp;#39;ll be rolling out courses that
examine the commonly offerd curricula but prepare teachers for a whole
lot more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s been an exciting week in NY CS Ed and there&amp;#39;s a lot more to come.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New York State moving forward with CS Teacher Certification</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ny-cs-certificate/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 12 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ny-cs-certificate/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Last April I woke up early and trekked up to Albany along with a few
of my Hunter College colleagues to share our thoughts on K12 Computer
Science teacher certification with the Board of Regents. We gave a
presentation to the Regents Higher Education Committee and afterwards
had a chance to talk with some of the Regents as well as other members
of the New York State Department of Education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I left feeling that our proposals were well received and I think
everyone present - both the Hunter and NYSED contingents hoped that
things would move forward on this important issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fast forward to today, December 8, 2017. I was up at the crack
of dawn. Driving in the dark in the snow from NYC to Albany to once
again attend a Board of Regents Higher Education Committee
meeting. This time, the agenda item was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposed Amendments to Part 30 of the Regents Rules and Section 52.21
and Part 80 the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education Relating
to a New Certification Area and Tenure Area for Computer Science&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
No discussion or debate this time around just the proposal. If I
understand the process correctly, this should come up again at the
March meeting at which point it will be voted on. If approved, it
looks like we&amp;#39;ll have a pathway towards certification for CS teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I haven&amp;#39;t had a chance to dive into the details but at the meeting a
few key points came up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the proposal indicates this will be a subject area in which a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;teacher can be certified and be awarded tenure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a traditional pathway for new teachers - Bachelors /&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masters degree&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be an alternative pathway for people entering from the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;workforce&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be an extension for teachers with another license so they&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;won&amp;#39;t have to give up tenure in their current license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be an &amp;#34;individual evaluation&amp;#34; pathway which sounds to me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;like it could catch people who fall through the cracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There looks to be a sensible ramp up period - until September 2022&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a grandfathering provision that looks to last 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds like a smart sensible plan. Multiple pathways, shallow
ramp up and provisions to protect existing teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, the devil is in the details. What&amp;#39;s an approved program?
Can a grandfathered teacher teach all CS classes or just intro ones?
etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I said, I haven&amp;#39;t had a chance to dive into the details yet but
this is very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Prior to the meeting I was chatting with a few other people
attending. One, a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uft.org/&#34;&gt;UFT&lt;/a&gt; representative was very excited about the
prospect. Another contingent, a group from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nysut.org/&#34;&gt;NYSUT&lt;/a&gt; was very much against
a new certification area. Their position was that this would create a
teacher shortage because no one would have a CS license and no one
would get one due to the difference in salary between teaching and the
tech industry. I&amp;#39;ve already written on how I feel that this is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/will-we-lose-cs-teachers-to-industry&#34;&gt;red
herring&lt;/a&gt;. What shocked me though was their feeling that &amp;#34;we already
have many non-CS teachers effectively teaching CS across the
state. They&amp;#39;re doing a great job and don&amp;#39;t need any additional content
or pedagogical knowledge.&amp;#34; I think they&amp;#39;re wrong and I also think that
when we as a community talk about how our summer professional
development is all that&amp;#39;s needed, we undercut CS education and
the teaching profession as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any event this was a big step for New York. I tried to individually
thank as many of the participants as I could for helping shepherd this
along but could only speak to a few so I&amp;#39;ll just give a blanket thank
you here to the NY State Board of Regents, Board of Education and
State Education department.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Self Certification - not a good idea</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/dont-self-certify/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/dont-self-certify/</guid>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;
You&amp;#39;ve probably seen an image like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/dont-self-certify/self-signed.png&#34; alt=&#34;/img/dont-self-certify/self-signed.png&#34; title=&#34;/img/dont-self-certify/self-signed.png&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s what you see when you try to access a secure web site but the web
site itself certified itself as being secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When people see this on a professional site it sets off all manner of
red flags. We feel much more comfortable when go to a site and we
don&amp;#39;t see that error. When we see the secure green lock in the url bar
indicating that this site is certified through an external trusted
source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s take this a step further. If you needed surgery would you go to
a board certified surgeon or would you go to Dr. Nick Riviera or some
other &amp;#34;self certified&amp;#34; doctor? Likewise you wouldn&amp;#39;t want to be
represented in court by someone who hasn&amp;#39;t passed the bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We might not feel that these certification and licensing processes are
perfect but when we need the services of a doctor or lawyer, we&amp;#39;re
happy these gatekeepers exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So we should all be extremely concerned with today&amp;#39;s announcement that
the deal for mayoral control just brokered in NYC came with strings
attached and one of those strings looks to open the doors to give some
charter chains the ability to self certify their teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s a story on it in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2017/07/06/with-city-charters-poised-to-win-certification-deal-education-schools-fret-113243&#34;&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt; and one in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/ny/2017/07/06/some-charter-school-teachers-could-become-certified-without-a-masters-under-proposed-new-suny-rules/&#34;&gt;Chalkbeat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One might think that some requirements to become a teacher are
ridiculous. I&amp;#39;ll get to them later  but this is really giving the fox
the keys to the henhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Charters appear to have extremely high rates of teacher attrition so
it makes sense that they want to control their teacher pipeline. This
alone should be a red flag against self certification but what else
are charter chains known for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misleading stats - claiming amazing passing numbers on standardized&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exams while neglecting to mention that somehow or other big blocks
of students were removed from the school prior to the test year
(&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shankerinstitute.org/blog/student-attrition-and-backfilling-success-academy-charter-schools-what-student-enrollment&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gotta go list&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forcing high levels of parent involvement (tough for single working&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;parents)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charging &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/education/article/KIPP-schools-collected-millions-in-unallowable-11257006.php&#34;&gt;illegal fees&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top this off with as taking resources from public schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Charters operate in anything but a transparent manner and we&amp;#39;re
expected to trust them to prepare &amp;#34;highly effective&amp;#34; teachers? I don&amp;#39;t
think so. Since there is no real accountability for charter schools -
they can easily game the system through student attrition, selective
admissions (by putting up barriers to enter the lottery) and test prep
they can pay lip service to teacher preparation and the public will be
none the wiser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we had a reasonable way of holding principals accountable and no,
test scores are not the answer then we could pretty much do away
with teacher certification. If principals were held to task to run an
effective school, something we can easily define but not measure, then
they would have every incentive to hire the best
teachers. Unfortunately we&amp;#39;re nowhere near that place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since we&amp;#39;re not, we&amp;#39;re left with the current systems of teacher
certification that has it&amp;#39;s own slew of problems. A big part of it, in
my opinion is that schools of education have lost the high
ground. While there are some institutions doing great work, reputation
wise, schools of education are held in very low regard. Strong
teachers trade stories of the watered down content classes and waste
of time classes where professors share their pet theories of
education. I can&amp;#39;t tell you how many times I&amp;#39;ve heard the new
definitive way to teach. At the same time, education research is
frequently held in low regard by teachers and the general public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the one hand we have charters run by and support by non-educators
wanting us to trust them and on the other we have institutions that
are questioned by the teachers they produce and the general public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t know the answer. I&amp;#39;m working on teacher certifications
programs at Hunter and it&amp;#39;s a balancing act. How much content is
sufficient and how much is too much. Can any of the general content be
streamlined or is it all necessary. If it isn&amp;#39;t necessary do we need
it anyway to satisfy the bean counters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you don&amp;#39;t have enough then we&amp;#39;re sending unprepared teachers into
the classroom. Too much and we&amp;#39;ll drive potential teachers away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As computer science education is defining itself we see similar
struggles. We have some people advocating certifications analogous to
existing teacher certifications. On the other extreme we have
advocates for two weeks summer training and you&amp;#39;re a CS teacher. I&amp;#39;d
like to think that I&amp;#39;m advocating for the sweet spot. Strong content
knowledge not tied to a specific course and matching content related
pedagogy. Time will tell becomes the certification standard and time
will tell whose approach was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For now, it&amp;#39;s important not to give away the store. Private charter
schools should not be the driving force behind teacher certification
and they certainly shouldn&amp;#39;t be allowed to train their own teachers
and then &amp;#39;teach&amp;#39; our students without much greater scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Addendum:
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m sure some of my friends will point out that private schools aren&amp;#39;t
held to any particular standard for teacher certification. This is
true but private schools don&amp;#39;t take public funds. Actually they do but
in my opinion, they shouldn&amp;#39;t. I maintain that charter schools are
publicly funded private schools in that they take public money but
operate as private entities. As such they should be held under the
greatest of scrutiny and standards – they aren&amp;#39;t&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
