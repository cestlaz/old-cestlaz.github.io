      <description>Yesterday I shared my thoughts on Bill de Blasio&#39;s plans to &#34;fix&#34; the selection criteria for New York City&#39;s specialized high schools. If you haven&#39;t read the post, you can find it here.

      <description>Yesterday, Bill de Blasio, the current Mayor of New York City outlined how he would &#34;fix&#34; our specialized schools. The schools he was referring to were the &#34;big three&#34; of Stuyvesant, Bronx Science, and Brooklyn Tech and then five additional schools - The High School for Math Science and Engineering at CCNY, The High School for American Studies at Lehman, Brooklyn Latin, The Queens Arts and Science High School at York College, and Staten Island Tech.</description>
