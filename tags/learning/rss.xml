      <description>Thanks to everyone who voted for topics or commented with suggestions for videos. I&amp;#39;ll try to get to them in the coming months.  Today is just a quick hit on Atomic Chrome - an Emacs package and browser extension that allows you to edit web form inputs with Emacs. UPDATE   I forgot to mention that you can set a shortcut key, at least in chrome rather than clicking on the icon.</description>

      <title>Using Emacs 39 - mu4e</title>

      <description>I generally use three email accounts. My personal one, work one, and one for my non-profit. For a couple of years, I&amp;#39;ve been using mu4e under Emacs for both my work and non-profit email accounts and gmail for my personal account.  I&amp;#39;ve had lots of requests for a video on what I do but I&amp;#39;ve been hesitant for two reasons:    There are parts of my configuration that are copied from others and    I really don&amp;#39;t understand.</description>

      <title>Using Emacs 38 - dired</title>

      <description>The 38th installment of Using Emacs is about dired, Emacs&amp;#39; built in mode for navigating and working with directories.  I&amp;#39;m not a dired power user and in fact am just now making a real effort to explore it and work it into my daily workflow and with that in mind, I&amp;#39;d love to hear some configuration and use suggestions from people who use it regularly.  Here&amp;#39;s the configuration I use: (use-package dired+ :ensure t :config (require &amp;#39;dired+) )   which merely adds dired+ into the mix.</description>

      <title>Using Emacs 37 - Treemacs file browser</title>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been meaning to get back to making Emacs videos but I&amp;#39;ve been having trouble figuring out what to record.  People have asked for Magit but I only use the basics and I think there are already some great videos on it out there. I&amp;#39;d also like to get more comfortable with DIRED mode and then do a video on it but I&amp;#39;m not there yet. I&amp;#39;ve also been looking into packages that manage workspaces like Eyebrowse and Persp-mode but neither are really doing it for my workflow.</description>

      <title>Using Emacs 36 - A Touch of Elisp</title>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been working on a vue.js project this summer. During the school year I really can&amp;#39;t dive into code so it&amp;#39;s been fun.  I&amp;#39;ve already showed you most of the Emacs tools I use for development. Projectile, Ace-Window, IBuffer, Swiper / Ivy and all. One thing I couldn&amp;#39;t easily do was arrange windows the way I wanted.  I&amp;#39;ve been setting up Emacs with one large window and a couple of smaller ones:   I can easily switch the buffer in the window and I can easily switch windows but what I wanted to do was swap the buffer in the large window with one of the smaller buffers and leave focus in the larger buffer:   I started looking at perspective mode and persp mode but neither work with the latest Emacs.</description>

      <title>Using Emacs 35 - Blogging</title>

      <description>Very little new Emacs in today&amp;#39;s episode of Using Emacs. The video shows my old blogging workflow and what I&amp;#39;m playing with now.  The only new Emacs covered is the prodigy package which lets you run services under Emacs. I use it to run Nikola&amp;#39;s development server but I think prodigy will also be useful when I start writing that knitting application I promised my wife.  When I started this blog, I used Jekyll.</description>
