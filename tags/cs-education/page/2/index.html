        This morning Mark Guzdial tweeted on his latest post:
Results from Longitudinal Study of Female Persistence in CS: AP CS matters, After-school programs and Internships do not https://t.co/GOzp3045Hp
&mdash; Mark Guzdial (@guzdial) October 14, 2019   I&#39;m glad Mark wrote about this as it&#39;s something that&#39;s important to both research and publicize but it&#39;s really not a surprise.
 I&#39;m going to start by dismissing the statement that &#34;… participation in the Aspirations awards program were teh best predictors of persistence three years after the high school survey in both CS and other technology-related majors.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        Alfred Thompson posted today about cheating on CS class projects. It was in response to Garth Flint&#39;s post on finding interesting projects which in turn referenced earlier posts by Alfred and me.
 Garth laments that it&#39;s hard to find projects that are both interesting and meaty but where solutions can&#39;t easily be searched for online. Alfred notes that cheating will happen and that it&#39;s an ethics issue. This is why I try to create a culture of sharing and acknowledging credit (that is, citing sources) but I&#39;m not naive enough to believe there isn&#39;t any cheating in my classes.

        There are things we do in school and there are things we do in industry and they&#39;re not always the same. In school we might use a learning language or an IDE which gives additional support and at times even take away language features while at work you might you might make heavy use of continuous integration tools.  On the other hand, sometimes we use the same things. Java is used in schools and in industry, StackOverflow consulted in both and many schools use professional IDEs like Eclipse.

        I recently did a unit where I had my students convert words into Pig Latin. I like the problem because to start it only requires strings, functions and if statements but there is some depth to the unit.
 We start with simplified rules:
 If the word starts with a vowel, add &#34;ay&#34; to the end of the word If it starts with a consonant move the first latter to the end and add &#34;ay&#34; don&#39;t worry about anything else  Students usually start with something like this:

        I recently took a look at the Cryptopals Crypto Challenges. It&#39;s a series of challenges through which you can learn all about crypto and crypto attacks. They say they&#39;ll eventually have solutions but since the site appears to be at least a few years old, who knows it they&#39;ll ever publish them.
 One interesting thing about the site is that it really doesn&#39;t have a lot of content to teach you the concepts around the challenges.

        I was planning on writing up all the exciting CS Education work I got to be involved in these past two days but I saw a post on one of the CS discussion forums that got me riled.  There&#39;s a teacher (name withheld to protect the innocent) who wants to create an advanced course for his students but his administration is requesting an outside measure of accountability. This sounds reasonable on the surface but I found it really insulting.

        I&#39;m enjoying reading about Ria Galanos&#39; new chapter on her blog. In her most recent post Ria briefly talks about the fact that very few professional developers start from scratch and most work in existing large code bases. She wonders why the College Board got rid of the APCS-A case study and talked about how it gave students an opportunity to work on a multi-file complex system. Over the past few years others have wondered if the College Board should bring it back.

        So, I got back from CSTA2019 and promptly got a summer cold which laid me up for the past couple of days.
 Phoenix was beautiful even with it being unbearably hot at times and it&#39;s a place I think I&#39;d like to visit again when it&#39;s a bit cooler.  I said in an earlier post that for me, CSTA is typically more of a person conference and less of a session conference and that held true again.

        Looking forward to flying out to Phoenix for CSTA-2019 Saturday morning. The conference doesn&#39;t officially start until Sunday, Monday for me since I&#39;m not doing any of the pre-conference workshops. We&#39;ll have most of Saturday as long as we&#39;re up to it, Sunday, and Monday morning. Actually, there is the GitHub reception on Sunday evening so that&#39;s kind of official conference stuff.
 As to the conference, I&#39;m super looking forward to it.
