      <title>Using Emacs Episode 80 Vertico, Marginalia, Consult, and Embark</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
In today&amp;#39;s video, we&amp;#39;ll take a look at a few new completion frameworks
for Emacs. For years I&amp;#39;ve been using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper&#34;&gt;Ivy&lt;/a&gt; and have been very happy with
it but since I decided to rebuild my Emacs config from scratch I
thought I&amp;#39;d try the new kids on the block, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum&#34;&gt;Selectrum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/minad/vertico&#34;&gt;Vertico&lt;/a&gt; along
with some support packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve liked Ivy from day one and still do. To be honest, from a day to day point of
view, I didn&amp;#39;t notice much difference between Ivy and the newcomers
but I do like their philosophies - they&amp;#39;re supposed to be simple and
minimalist and focus on the Emacs completion API without extending
it. You can read about their respective philosophies on their GitHub
pages. Conveniently, both have sections comparing themselves with the
other frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For configurations, I just cut and pasted the suggested configs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ultimately I settled on Vertico but both are worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The video shows off Vertico but arguably more importantly, it covers
some of the ancillary packages. First, although I don&amp;#39;t show much
about them are Prescient and Orderless - they let you control how your
selections pop up. I&amp;#39;m using Orderless which lets me search for
components by typing partial completions and using spaces to separate
but it lets you do it in any order. What I mean is that if I&amp;#39;m looking
for the command &amp;#34;vertico-mode&amp;#34; I can search by typing something like
&amp;#34;vert mode&amp;#34; which is what I&amp;#39;ve always done, but I can also do the
search for &amp;#34;mo vert&amp;#34; - typing the second part first. That&amp;#39;s pretty
slick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next is Marginalia which brings up extra context information when you
search for things. Things like command descriptions or file modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The third one we look at is Consult which is basically a collection of
useful commands using completions. Basically an answer to Ivy&amp;#39;s
Counsel commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, and this is the show stopper, the video shows Embark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Using Emacs 79 Project</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-79-project/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 11:24:36 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-79-project/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
One of the comments on my last video talked about the new project
management support Emacs includes in it&amp;#39;s latest version -
project.el. I remembered reading about it when it rolled around but
then forgot and never checked it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Up until recently when working in projects I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile&#34;&gt;Projectile&lt;/a&gt;, a great
package by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/bbatsov&#34;&gt;Bozhidar Batsov&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Bug. I only used it when
doing development work - that&amp;#39;s when I find myself jumping around
within a group of related files. At other times, I&amp;#39;m pretty much in
one file, do my thing, then move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I wrote a post and did a video on Projectile a while ago - you can
check it out [[&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-33-projectile-jump/&#34;&gt;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-33-projectile-jump/&lt;/a&gt;
][here]].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I mentioned in the last video, I decided to rebuild my Emacs config
from scratch and I&amp;#39;m trying to be a bit more minimalist so with that
reminder I got, I figure it&amp;#39;s time to check out the now built in
project.el. If it&amp;#39;s as good as projectile, or even, good enough, it
could be a nice alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At it&amp;#39;s core, project.el works similarly to projectile. There&amp;#39;s a
prefix key an then an action which is restricted to your project. For
projectile, it was &lt;code&gt;C-c p&lt;/code&gt; and the default for project.el is &lt;code&gt;C-x
p&lt;/code&gt;. No big difference there. Projectile seems to have many many more
options but in general, I find that all I need is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switch to a project - &lt;code&gt;C-x p p&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find or open a file in a project - &lt;code&gt;C-x p f&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switch buffers in a project - &lt;code&gt;C-x p b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delete all the project buffers - &lt;code&gt;C-x p k&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List the project buffers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project.el has all except listing all the buffers. It also supports a
few other features that I think I&amp;#39;ll find useful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;project dired - &lt;code&gt;C-x p d&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;project shell (or eshell) &lt;code&gt;C-x p s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;project regex search and variants &lt;code&gt;C-x p g&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure if projectile has these. It probably does and I could see
them being useful. I probable won&amp;#39;t use the regex searches much
because I&amp;#39;ll likely use other tools for those like consult-ripgrep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, it certainly seems like project.el has enough coverage for my
purposes. Another difference between the two projects is that
project.el only supports a couple of project definitions - things that
are supported by Emacs&amp;#39; VC system ad things supported by Emacs EDE
thing (which I&amp;#39;ve never really played with). I seem to recall
Projectile being more flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any event, project.el looks like it&amp;#39;s a nice simple alternative at
least for me. Check out the video for the runthrough:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My project grading workflow</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-78-grading/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 10 Oct 2021 10:44:41 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-78-grading/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Grading sucks. Even for a well crafted assignment it takes time and
rarely does it give you the same insights into your students as you
can get from just observing them and working with them, at least when
the environment supports you doing so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This leads lots of teachers to go to auto graders. I can&amp;#39;t bring
myself going along with that. While assignments are imperfect and
tedious to grade, they do provide some insight to your students and
that&amp;#39;s an important part about being a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, I always keep my eye out for ways to improve my project gradiing
workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the video below, I step through my process. It&amp;#39;s mostly Emacs but I
also use GitHub classroom and the terminal along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you&amp;#39;re here as for the Emacs, I&amp;#39;d any thoughts on alternatives or
improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you&amp;#39;re here as a teacher, I&amp;#39;d love to hear what your flow is like
and what tools you use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Enjoy&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Final thoughts on Advent of Code 2020</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-final-thoughts/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 27 Dec 2020 15:57:22 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-final-thoughts/</guid>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;
Time for some final thoughts on &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/&#34;&gt;Advent of Code 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This was my sixth Advent of Code but the first time I completed all 25
days. Better than last year&amp;#39;s 31 and a whole lot better than my
weakest effort of 11 stars in 2017. I managed to find the time to
finish all but two on the day they were released and finished those
two on Christmas morning. This was also the first year I wrote all my
solutions in Clojure and I also made a bunch of blog posts and videos
(linked on the bottom of this post).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From my point of view 2020 was the best AoC to date and I&amp;#39;m not just
saying that because I finished all the problems. Well, maybe I am but
it&amp;#39;s really because the content and release of content lent itself to
my completing all the problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before jumping in to my specific commentary I want to remind readers
that anyone&amp;#39;s perceptions of an event like this will be biased. If
there&amp;#39;s an aspect that I particularly liked you can bet there&amp;#39;s
someone else out there who didn&amp;#39;t like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Overall content
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As usual a wide range of topics were covered including binary numbers,
pattern matching, simulation, dynamic programming, mathy stuff,
parsing, graph algorithms and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I didn&amp;#39;t find myself totally lost on any questions. There were some
problems that at least to me seemed to require graph algorithms and
one where dynamic programming or at least memoization was a boon but
for the most part it seemed that problems were indeed
approachable. Even the math day that had a bunch of reddit chatter
over the Chinese Remainder Theorem could be done without knowing about
the CRM. That was good because I had never heard of it (and if any of
the redditors who mentioned that it should  common knowledge, it
shouldn&amp;#39;t - I have an undergrad in CS and a Masters in CS along wit 30
years of teaching and this is the first time I&amp;#39;ve seen it). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In past years there always seemed to be a few problems that you needed
some preexisting knowledge to attempt. I had no problem with that - no
need to have  to finish all the problems and there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong
with hitting up reddit, learning something new and then tackling the
problem. This year it seemed that the problems more directly led to
the knowledge. I&amp;#39;ll talk about this more later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
Problem size
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For the most part the problems were the perfect size for me. I&amp;#39;d read
the problems when I woke up, work on part 1 after my run and then part
2 later in the day - at least that was the ideal - bugs and life
sometimes got in the way. None of the problems required pages and
pages of code for the solutions which I liked. Problems were clever
and interesting but led to moderately sized solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In past years, the weekend problems were longer and/or harder. The
logic being that there&amp;#39;s more time to work on them. I never liked
that. AoC is great but it&amp;#39;s an add on. It&amp;#39;s an add on to work during
the week but it&amp;#39;s an add on to family time on the weekend. I liked
that this year the only weekend problem that was much larger and longer
was day 20 - the image reconstruction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is not to say that some problems didn&amp;#39;t take a good deal of time
but rather that once you had an approach you didn&amp;#39;t sit down and say
&amp;#34;oh man, now I have to write hundreds of lines of code to implement
this.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-3&#34;&gt;
particularly nice problems 
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In spite of my not finishing part 2 until the last day, I loved day
20 - Jurassic Jigsaw. It was a little long and I spend more time than
I care to admit on debugging a really silly error but I loved the
problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, it had staged difficulty -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parse the data into a reasonable representation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do a partial edge matching for part 1 (not so hard)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do the harder / longer matching to reconstruct the image&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remove the border and solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, you actually discovered something - you &lt;strong&gt;found&lt;/strong&gt; sea
monsters!!!! You had a problem with an &amp;#34;unknown&amp;#34; solution and you
figured it out. Contrast that with say, day 2 where you just had to
validate passwords. That was also a fun problem but there was no big
reveal. It was really cool to decode your image and actaully find the
hidden monsters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Day 16 and 21 allowed for similar discovery at the end but not quite
as cool. I liked 16 very much but had a hard time getting my head
around the example for 21. Still a cool problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-4&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-4&#34;&gt;
Teachable stuff
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-4&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As usual, I found a lot that I liked as a teacher in AoC. I love that
many of the problems introduce problem solvers to new things. For me,
the Chinese Remainder Theorem was new even though I only discovered it
via the subreddit. Cellular Automata was prominently featured
this year, binary explicitly mentioned as was recursion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The recursion problem was particularly nice. The setup led to and, if
I recall, explicitly mentioned recursion. It also talks about a key
challenge - data mutability. The question states that after returning
from a &amp;#34;subgame&amp;#34; - the recursion - you have to continue the original
game from where it left off - state management. If you&amp;#39;re language
passes references in your calls this could lead to trouble. I&amp;#39;m
guessing (hoping?) that for people who solved that day who were new to
recursion got a deeper understanding than just through the usual n!
and such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another thing I liked was the spiraling. That, in teacher talk, is
when you go back to an earlier topic. This year had three questions
based on Cellular Autoamta. The first was the basic, the next took you
to a higher dimension and the third to a different shape. Each one
reviewed and extend fro the earlier problem. I loved it. This might
sound similar to last year&amp;#39;s intcode but the difference is that evne
if you didn&amp;#39;t complete the earlier problems you had a shot at the
latter ones. With Intcode if you had something wrong with your earlier
interpreter you were out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The allergens problem also allowed for the use of the same method you
used to solve the boarding pass problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Loved the spiraling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I could probably go on but this post is already long enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-5&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-5&#34;&gt;
Links
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-5&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ll finish off with links to my earlier posts on Advent of Code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Already looking forward to next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/24&#34;&gt;Day 24&lt;/a&gt; didn&amp;#39;t take that much time so I had a chance to go back and
finish &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/21&#34;&gt;day 21&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As usual, all my code is up &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/advent2020&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Day 21
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/21&#34;&gt;Problem Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It took me a while to get my head around this example. You have a set
of recipes. Each recipe has a list of ingredients and a list of
allergens. Your job for part 1 was basically to determine which
ingredients don&amp;#39;t contain any allergens. Part 2 had you determining
which ingredient had which allergen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part of what I think made this hard was that ingredients were just
random strings of letters as opposed to actual ingredients or at least
pronounceable words or letter strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The key part of the description as that each allergen was present in
&lt;strong&gt;exactly one&lt;/strong&gt; ingredient and each ingredient had &lt;strong&gt;at most&lt;/strong&gt; one
allergen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, for part 1, the tact was for each allergen, take all the recipes
that had it. In the example, the first and second recipes had
dairy (one indexing). Since only one ingredient can have the dairy
allergen the that ingredient must be in both lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you take all the recipes that have the dairy allergen and take each
of their lists of ingredients as a set and find all their
intersections, you&amp;#39;ll be left with all the ingredients that can have
the dairy allergen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Do this with all the allergens and you&amp;#39;ll have all the ingredients
that could contain them. The other igredients are safe and lead to the
answer to part 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part 2 had you identifying each ingredient / allergen
pair. Fortunately, the data set we ended up with for part 1 - each
allergen and it&amp;#39;s list of possible ingredients was made to order. One
of them had only one ingredient per allergen. We could identify that
one and then remove that ingredient from the remaining allergen&amp;#39;s
lists. Then repeat to find the next one and then the next. This is
similar to the solution to day 16. Of course this isn&amp;#39;t a general
solution but fortunately the data was all set up for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
Day 24
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/24&#34;&gt;Problem Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back to Cellular Automata!!!!!! The catch this time is the world is a
hex grid. This means that each cell has six neighbors so using a 2D
array or similar representation seems like an even worse idea than it
was for the 3D and 4D problems earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even before representing the world parsing was an issue. Since a given
cell can have neighbors to the east, west, northeast, northwest,
southeast or southwest, instructions are given with a line of &amp;#34;moves&amp;#34;
describing a tile to flip starting from 0,0. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For example, the line &amp;#34;EEE&amp;#34; would move three east from the origin and
flip that tile while &amp;#34;ESEE&amp;#34; would move one east, one southest and then
one further east and flipt the tile there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fortunately, this wasn&amp;#39;t too bad. As we traverse down the line, if we
see an &lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt; or a &lt;strong&gt;w&lt;/strong&gt; then the instruction is one character so we add
the instruction to a list of steps an then continue. Otherwise the
instruction is 2 characters so we take 2 and add the instruction adn
then proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next was the data representation. It seemed that a list of live cells
would again be the best solution. I figured on using this mapping: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;E&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(-2,0)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;W&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(2,0)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;NE&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(-1,-1)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;NW&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(1,-1)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;SE&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(-1,1)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;SW&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(1,1)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I later found out that this is called &amp;#34;double coordinates.&amp;#34; Since
we&amp;#39;re not storing the full hex grid there&amp;#39;s no waste anyway and I
wasn&amp;#39;t planning on making a visualization so I didn&amp;#39;t worry about how
this would map to an actual screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, finding the coordinate of a tile was pretty easy. In Clojure
it&amp;#39;s: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-clojure&#34; data-lang=&#34;clojure&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;;; assume deltas is a lookup dictionary of the above mapping&lt;/span&gt;

  (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;defn &lt;/span&gt;get-tile-location [steps]
    (reduce (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;fn &lt;/span&gt;[loc step]
              (map + loc (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;deltas&lt;/span&gt;  step))
              ) [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;] steps))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In Python it would look more like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# assume deltas is a dictionary with the above mapping&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# and steps is a list of instructions [&amp;#34;e&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;w&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;se&amp;#34;, etc]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; step &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; steps:
      loc &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; [sum(x) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; x &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; zip(loc, deltas[step])]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We can now convert any input line of instructions to a coordinate. If
we write a routine to flip a tile we can now set up our world and
answer part 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part 2 involved basically turning the part 1 world into a cellular
automaton. Fortunately, this was easy given the solution to earlier CA
problems. It as just a matter of updating the get-neighbors routine
and the rule to go from one generation to the next and we&amp;#39;re done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I enjoyed this - it was a nice twist on the earlier CA
questions. First we had a simple CA, then higher dimensions and now
changing the layout of the world but still within 2 dimensions. Once
we had a way of representing a tile and mapping from a tile to its
neighbors we had already solved the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One more day to go but it&amp;#39;s been a nice run of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>A Teacher Looks at Advent of Code 2020 - 19 through 23</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-19-23/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Dec 2020 15:09:38 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-19-23/</guid>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;
A few days have past so it&amp;#39;s time for an update. Two more days to go
and while I haven&amp;#39;t completed all the problems, I have accumulated 43
stars which is a personal best. Given the nature of the problems I&amp;#39;m
missing, I might even go back and do them at some point. Of course, I
may very well also just crash out on the final two days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As usual, all my code is up &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/advent2020&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Day 19
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/19&#34;&gt;Problem Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not a whole lot to say about this one. It&amp;#39;s the weekend and AoC has
traditionally had longer / harder problems over the weekends. I was
surprised when the first weekend&amp;#39;s problems - 12 and 13 weren&amp;#39;t
significantly longer than the surrounding days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I read over this and it screamed &lt;strong&gt;parser&lt;/strong&gt; and to be honest, I really
wasn&amp;#39;t up for writing a parser on a Saturday morning. Instead, I
cheaped out.  I looked for a Clojure parser generator and found
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/engelberg/instaparse&#34;&gt;instaparse&lt;/a&gt;. What&amp;#39;s more, instaparse supported input in the form of the
provided AoC data so I literally just had to read the grammar into
instaparse and run it on the data for the answer. Part 2 was pretty
much the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
Day 20
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/20&#34;&gt;Problem Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This was the big one. Basically taking 144 tiles and figuring out how
to form them in an image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I finished part 1. I read in all the tiles and then for each, compared
it&amp;#39;s edges with the edges of the other tiles (and the reverse of the
edges to account for transformations). This told me how many other
tiles each tile connects with. Central tiles each connect to 4 other
ties, edges, to three but corners only to 2. Part 1 just had you find
the corners so it wasn&amp;#39;t too big a deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part 2 involves assembling the image and then finding sea monsters. I
haven&amp;#39;t done this yet. Armed with the corner, it should be easy to
find the top row and then build the image going down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think it&amp;#39;s going to be a bear to code though since each tile has to
be transformed via flipping and/or rotating into the correct
orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m hoping to get back to it. We&amp;#39;ll see though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-3&#34;&gt;
Day 21
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-3&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/21&#34;&gt;Problem Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Haven&amp;#39;t done this one yet. Just couldn&amp;#39;t get my head around the
example on an early Monday morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;ll finish question 20 but I do really hope to get
back to give this one a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-4&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-4&#34;&gt;
Day 22
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-4&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/22&#34;&gt;Problem Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part 1 here was pretty straightforward - you had a few rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if player 1&amp;#39;s deck is empty, player 2 wins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if player 2&amp;#39;s deck is empty, player 1 wins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;otherwise both players draw a card and whoever drew the higher card gets both, they go on the
back of the winners deck and you continue play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it. Basically just run the simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part 2 added a recursive subgame. Under certain circumstances you
pause the current game and do a little subgame. The catch is that you
have to save the state of the current game and when the subgame or
subgames end, you continue the suspended game from where you left off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This means that if you are representing your decks with arrays or some
other data structure where you can change the elements you have to be
careful. In Clojure, however, where data is immutable by default you
don&amp;#39;t have to worry about that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was basically able to just rewrite my play routine for the new
rules and whenever we had to go to a subgame, I just made a
traditional recursive call. My guess is that if I had coded this up
originally in Java or C++ I probably would have had a harder time
going from part 1 to part 2. On the other hand, there were some
problems with Java or C++ would have made my part 1 to part 2
transitions easier - depends on the problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-5&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-5&#34;&gt;
Day 23
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-5&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/23&#34;&gt;Problem Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This was the fun one - at least from a teacher&amp;#39;s point of view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Like day 22 you had to implement a game. You set up a bunch of
numbered cups in a circle and then: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;remove the three cups right after the current cup&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;find out where they should be reinserted based on the game rules
(see the problem link for details)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;reinsert those three cups at that reinsertion point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;move from the current cup to the next cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did part 1 using a simple list and list manipulations. I used
Clojure but the python equivalent would be to have a list representing
all the cups, move around ti with mod, and remove cups and add them
using slices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# given board = [3,8,9,1,2,5,4,6,7&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# to get the next board state&lt;/span&gt;
  current &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; board[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;]
  to_remove &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; board[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;]
  remaining &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; board[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;:]
  idx &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; find_target(board,remove)
  newboard &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; remaining[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;:idx] &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; to_remove &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; remaining[idx:] &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; [current]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I might have the indexing a little off and the &lt;code&gt;find_target&lt;/code&gt; routine
isn&amp;#39;t shown adn might have different parameters. As I&amp;#39;ve said, I wrote
my solution in Clojure. This should give the general idea though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You basically had to run through 10 turns to find the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part 2 added a twist - the game board was now &lt;strong&gt;one million&lt;/strong&gt; in size
and you had to run the simulation through &lt;strong&gt;ten million&lt;/strong&gt; turns. No way
was my part 1 solution going to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The problem called for something that required fewer list traversals
and builds and where it would be quick and easy to find a given
element. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My first thought was to build a traditional linked list. That would
help but it would also require a number of linear traversals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next thought? How about a dictionary? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you set up a dictionary where the keys are the nodes and the values
represent the pointer to the next node you could really quickly and
easily both traverse and manipulate the data set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For example, if your board was [3,8,9,1] then you&amp;#39;d use this
dictionary to represent it - remember the 1 wraps back around to
the 3.
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;  nodes &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; {&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;,
           &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;,
           &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;,
           &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So if you&amp;#39;re current node was represented in a variable &lt;code&gt;current&lt;/code&gt; the
three nodes you&amp;#39;ll remove would be &lt;code&gt;[nodes[current],
noeds[nodes[current]], nodes[nodes[nodes[current]]] ]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As an added bonus, the question pointed out that your data set would
have every positive integer represented once. That is, part 1 had a 9
item list with all the values 1 through 9 and the million item one had
values 1 through 1 million. This makes finding the insertion point
both easy and fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It turns out that I think the dictionary based solution is actually
cleaner than the list one in addition to being faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This solution was no speed demon - still took ~40 seconds to get an
answer but that&amp;#39;s good enough for me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of the problems I wrote up today, this one was my favorite. Students
typically think of data structures as what they are - if they have an
array, use it as an array, a linked list is a linked list and a
dictionary or hash table is, well, you know. If you need a linked
list, you need to make a traditional linked list - not so. this is a
great example of using a dictionary as a hash table. There are
conceptual data structures and actual in computer
representations. Often you use the implementation directly - use a
hash table to store data for lookup or use an array to represent a
list. It can be very empowering though when the student sees that
the implementations are just tools in the belt and they can be used in
all sorts of interesting ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>A Teacher Looks at Advent of Code 2020 - Days 17 and 18</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-1718/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Dec 2020 12:35:57 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-1718/</guid>
      <description>
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Day 17
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/17&#34;&gt;Day 17&lt;/a&gt; brought back Cellular Automata. It was a nice follow up to &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day11/&#34;&gt;day
11&lt;/a&gt;. In my &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day11/&#34;&gt;writeup&lt;/a&gt; I talked about data representation - how a Cellular
Automoton like Conway&amp;#39;s game of life is a nice 2D array project in a
class like APCS-A but multi dimensional arrays are only one way to
represent a cellular automaton. Day 17 really drove that home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The actual rules were pretty simple - if a cell is active and has 2 or
3 active neighbors it stays active. If it&amp;#39;s inactive and has three
active it becomes active. Otherwise the cell is inactive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The catch for part 1 is that this CS is in three dimensions. Each and
a cell&amp;#39;s neighbors are defined as all coordinates that differ by one
in any of the three dimensions. So, if a cell is at an (x,y,z) location
it&amp;#39;s neighbors will be at (x+1,y,z), (x-1,y,z), (x+1,y+1,z),
(x+1,y-1,z), etc. for 26 neighbors in all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You could use a list  within a list within a list or a three
dimensional array to represent your world but that&amp;#39;s tricky and error
prone. What&amp;#39;s worse, part 2 took the CA into the fourth dimension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Better is to just keep a list or set of active cells. Then the problem
becomes pretty easy. You need to be able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find all of a cell&amp;#39;s neighbors - this is pretty easy because you
can iterate over all the +1 and -1 possibilities for each of the x,
y, and z values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find all the potential cells for the next state - this is also
pretty easy because it&amp;#39;s the set of all cells that are currently
active along with all of their neighbors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Count a given cell&amp;#39;s active neighbors - this is easy once you&amp;#39;ve
done the find neighbors routine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A way to test if a cell is active which is just checking to see if
it&amp;#39;s in your active cells list or set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, it&amp;#39;s pretty easy to run the CA: 
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# pythonesque pseudocode &lt;/span&gt;
potential_cells &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; find_all_neighbors(current_active_cells)
new_cells &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; []
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; cell &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; potential_cells: 
  n &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; count_neighbors(cell)
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; is_active(cell) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; (n&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; n&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;):
    new_cells&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;append(cell)
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;elif&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; is_active(cell)) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; n&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;:
    new_cells&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;append(cell)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then you just have to run generate new states until you get the
answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part 2 extended the CA to 4 dimensions. If you had a multidimensional
array this would get super message but with a list of active cells,
the changes are minimal - just add an extra coordinate, update getting
the neighbors and you&amp;#39;re good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a case of where thinking through your data representation can
be a big win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Clojure code &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/advent2020/blob/main/src/day17.clj&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
Day 18
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/18&#34;&gt;Day 18&lt;/a&gt; was all about evaluating math expressions. For part 1 you had
parenthesized expressions consisting of numbers * and + that you had
to evaluate but you had to do it by first doing parens then left to
right - multiplication was not a higher precedence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This sounds like a parsing first problem but it turns out I was able
to exploit some of Clojure&amp;#39;s language features. Looking at the
subreddit after solving it seems that a bunch of other languages also
have features that could be exploited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Clojure represents data (and programs) as &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression&#34;&gt;S-Expressions&lt;/a&gt; - basically
stuff in parens. As a prefix language, instead of writing 10+20, in
Clojure you&amp;#39;d write &lt;code&gt;(+ 10 20)&lt;/code&gt;, that is  run the plus function on 10
and 20. If you have something lie &lt;code&gt;(+ 10 (* 20 3))&lt;/code&gt;, Clojure has to
evaluate the inner S-Expression (sexp) before it can add that to +10
so Clojure can do the parsing for us. We can take an input string and
convert it to an sexp using &lt;code&gt;read-string&lt;/code&gt;  but if we just try to do
&lt;code&gt;(read-string &amp;#34;1 + 2 + 3&amp;#34;)&lt;/code&gt; we&amp;#39;d get an error because &amp;#34;1 + 2 + 3&amp;#34;
isn&amp;#39;t a valid sexp so we just surround it by parens:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-clojure&#34; data-lang=&#34;clojure&#34;&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;def &lt;/span&gt;equation-sexp (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;read-string&lt;/span&gt; (str &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;(&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;1 + 2 * 3 + (4 * 5 )&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;)&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The above would leave us with the sexp (1 + 2 * 3 + (4 * 5 )).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next, forgetting the inner parens, we can write a function that will
evaluate an sexp of the form (1 + 2 * 3 + …) etc. Basically, this can
be done with a reduce. Start with the first value then take the rest
of the list two at a time, the first of each pair is an operator and
the second is an operand so apply the operand to the other number in
the pair and your overall result so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In Clojure it looks like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-clojure&#34; data-lang=&#34;clojure&#34;&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;defn &lt;/span&gt;part1-eval [f &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; r]
  (reduce (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;fn &lt;/span&gt;[ans [op next]]
            (apply op [ans next] )) f (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;partition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; r)))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next, we insert that function name to the start of each sexp so 
(1 + 2 * 3 + (4 * 5*)) becomes (part1-eval 1 + 2 * 3 + (part1-eval 4 *
5)). Finally we can do a  Clojure &lt;strong&gt;eval&lt;/strong&gt; on this form which will run
part1-eval on the rest of the sexp which will first run part1-eval on
the 4 * 5, that will return the 20 and then the first part1-eval will
finish it&amp;#39;s calculations to give you the answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part 2 was similar but there you had to perform addition before
multiplication. All that was necessary was write a part2-eval function
that would stand in for the part1-eval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The idea is to take an sexp like (1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5) we first split this
list around the * this gives us (1 + 2) (&lt;strong&gt;) (3 + 4) (&lt;/strong&gt;) (5). We then
filter this to remove the non numbers which gives (1 2) () (3 4) (5)
(). Then we remove the empty lists: (1 2) (3 4) (5). Add the elements
of each list: 3 7 5 and then multiply them together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All the code is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/advent2020/blob/main/src/day18.clj&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I like day 17 a lot or some variant for students to discuss data
representations but I think 18 is a little more advanced and probably
wouldn&amp;#39;t touch it in an early CS class - it was fun to work through
though :-). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>A Teacher Looks at Advent of Code 2020 - day 16</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day16/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Dec 2020 17:12:56 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day16/</guid>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;
Today&amp;#39;s problem was a fun one to solve. Why was it fun? Stay tuned,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The basic gist is that you have a plane ticket which is a set of
numbers but you don&amp;#39;t know which number maps to which category - row,
seat, gate, etc. You also know the number ranges for each
category. For example, row might be a number between 6 and 11 or 33
through 44 while a seat might be 13 through 40 or 45 through 50. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, you also can see a number of nearby tickets - each also as
tring of numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For part 1 you had to determine how many of the nearby tickets are
valid. A ticket is valid if all the numbers on it fall into at least
one category range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/16&#34;&gt;full description&lt;/a&gt; for all the details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First up - parsing - a little cumbersome but not too bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Split the input into the three main sections - categories, your
ticket, nearby tickets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convert the categories into a usable form&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convert your ticket into a list of numbers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convert the nearby tickets into a list of tickets each one being a
list of numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking each step in turn and it&amp;#39;s not too bad - particularly if you&amp;#39;re
comfortable with regular expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
part 1
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Representing the categories leads us to our first interesting
decision. How will we test to see if a ticket is valid and based on
that how will we represent the categories?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Each category has two ranges connected with an &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;example&#34;&gt;
row: 6-11 or 33-44
seat: 13-40 or 45-50
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One could make a construct to hold the bounds, loop through the nearby
tickets and for each value, run an if statement with the two ranges
connected by an &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is where a class can talk about code vs data - a topic I&amp;#39;m really
fond of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Instead of taking the above range and having some test like: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; number &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; ticket:
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (number &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; low1 &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; number &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; high1) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; \
     (number &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; low2 &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; number &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; high2):
       do something&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
or specifically for the row example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; number &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; ticket:
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (number &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; number &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; \
     (number &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;33&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; number &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;44&lt;/span&gt;):
       do something&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
you could make a set with all the possible seats  and then just test
to see if the seat was in the set: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;r1 &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; set( range(low1,high&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;))
r2 &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; set( range(low2,hight2&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;))
valid_seats &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; r1&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;union(r2)

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# then later&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; seat &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; valid_seats:
  do something&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I just find this more elegant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For part 1 I just made a big set with all the valid seats and then
checked each ticket to see if each if its numbers were in the valid
seats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
part 2
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For part 2 first you had to remove all the invalid tickets from the
nearby tickets. Since you figured out how to identify a valid ticket
in part one this shouldn&amp;#39;t be too ahrd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then we have to sleuth out which column from the tickets represented
which category. This would make a great group activity in a class,
particularly with an interactive language. This is a great data
exploration and representation problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To get more data, I thought I&amp;#39;d write a routine to pull all of one
column from the nearby tickets. Then I could see if all the values in
that row were valid for a particular category. For example, are all
the first numbers of all the tickets valid numbers for row. If so,
that column could represent row. Of course it could also represent
something else as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now that i could test to see if a column is valid for a category I
decided to build some data. I built a list of all the possible
categories for each row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part of it looked sort of like this (but in clojure):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;[ [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;, [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;wagon&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;arrival-station&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;] ],
  [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;, [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;wagon&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;arrival-station&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;route&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;train&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;row&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;]]
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Examining this table, I noticed that one row had only one category,
another had only 2 then one three etc. Great - we can now solve this
by plugging in the row we know, then the next one, then the next etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The explorations led to an easy answer. I sorted the list and looped
through. At each iteration I: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Added the current category and its associated row to the solution
set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removed that category from the rest of the lines&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When done we had a dictionary with a mapping from category to
row. From there it was pretty simple to find the part 2 answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Lots of good stuff here. I love the data explorations and the way it
can lead to a pretty straightforward solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Full solution in clojure can be found here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/16&#34;&gt;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So far I&amp;#39;ve managed to complete each day - 32 stars. That beats my 31
from last year adn my top year of 40 back in 2016. Tomorrow I give my
last exams and grading ca really begin so we&amp;#39;ll see if I can keep
going but so it&amp;#39;s been a fun Advent of Code year so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>A teacher looks at Advent of Code day 14</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day14/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 14 Dec 2020 14:30:47 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day14/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Time for &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/14&#34;&gt;Day 14&lt;/a&gt;!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I didn&amp;#39;t write up day 12 but here&amp;#39;s a Clojure &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8fvaAZRtts&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; runthrough. I also
didn&amp;#39;t write up day 13 mostly because I hacked together my part 2 in
Python and still want to rewrite it in decent clojure. In any event,
all my solutions are up on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/advent2020&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Day 14 had a few interesting things going on. At its core it&amp;#39;s a small
machine simulator where you have to deal with binary numbers. One of
the rubs is that the numbers are 36 digits which could be a problem if
your language / machine uses 32 bits to represent integers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Right off, assuming you have large enough ints you have an interesting
choice. Do you work with the data them as numbers or do you just do
string manipulations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I decided to do part 1 as numbers which leads to a nice little
exercise of using bitwise logic operations to turn bits on or off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part 2 was better solved, at least for me using string
manipulations. That part had a nice little recursive subproblem -
mapping wildcard values in the &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; to all the possible combinations
of zeros and ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Both problems also had a bit of fun parsing and, at least for me, a
few neat clojure constructs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think you could turn this problem into a fun set of class
exercises. My code can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/advent2020/blob/main/src/day14.clj &#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and even if you don&amp;#39;t do Clojure,
you might want to check out the video runthrough:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Teacher looks at Advent of Code 2020 - days 9 and 10</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day0910/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Dec 2020 16:52:45 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day0910/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
As we get closer to the end of the semester and time becomes scarcer
I&amp;#39;m wondering how many more I&amp;#39;ll finish. Barely had time to do days 9
and 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not much to say about &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/9&#34;&gt;day 9&lt;/a&gt; Part one was basically a rehash of day 1
part 1 but with a sliding widow. Part 2? I just brute force tried all
the subranges. I meant to go back to try to improve the solution but
didn&amp;#39;t have a chance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Clojure code can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/advent2020/blob/main/src/day09.clj&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/10&#34;&gt;Day 10&lt;/a&gt; was more interesting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I misread part 1 but ultimately, my solution was to: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;read in the data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sort it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prepend a 0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;append an additional value of the max + 3 to the end&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then loop through comparing adjacent values and keep track of the
differences which can be 1, 2, or 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;data&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;[ int(x) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; x &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; open(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;../data/sample10-1.dat&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;readlines()]
data&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;sort()
data&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;insert(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;)
data&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;append(max(data)&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;)

j&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;]
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; i &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; range(len(data)&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;):
    diff&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;data[i&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;data[i]
    j[diff&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;j[diff&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

print(j)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part 2 was where the fun starts - how many combinations of adapters
will take you from the start to the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For example, if we had adapters with voltages 1,4,5,6 given the
problem constraints that you can only connect an adapter to another
with a &amp;#34;joltage&amp;#34; of up to three less, you can only use the 1 voltage 1
way (coming from the source of 0).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
4 can connect to only 1 so it can only be used 1 way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
5 can connect to 4 so it too can only be used 1 way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
6 is a change, it can connect to 5 or 4 so you could chain either
6–&amp;gt;5–&amp;gt;4–&amp;gt;1 or 6–&amp;gt;4–&amp;gt;1 so you can get to 6 two ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If a student knows recursion and recursive search it&amp;#39;s easy enough to
code something that tries all the paths but it&amp;#39;s going to get very
slow very fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With a couple of insights though this can lead to a nice dynamic
programming type solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First thing to notice is that, similar to day 7, instead of looking at
how many adapters a lower joltage adapter can lead to we can look at how
many lower joltage adapters a given adapter could have come from. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To do this, we can look at the adapters as a graph. We can build a
dictionary where the keys are the adapter joltages and the entries are
the lower joltage adapters it can connect with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;

&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;build_reverse_map&lt;/span&gt;(data):
    graph&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;{}
    data &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; data[::&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;]
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; i &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; range(len(data)):
        current &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; data[i]
        j&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;;
        &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; (j&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;len(data) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; data[i] &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; data[j] &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;):
            j&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;j&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
        graph[current]&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;data[i&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;:j]
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; graph

rmap &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; build_reverse_map(data)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Line 3 reverses the list then for each item in the list, lines 6
through 8 find the adapters it can connect with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The next insight is that instead of calculating all the possibilities
we can build them a step at a time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Consider the first voltage from our above example of 1,4,5,6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
1 – it can only go to 0 so 0 is its only &amp;#34;neighbor&amp;#34; in the graph. We
can only get there 1 way so we can store 1 in ways[1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
4 – same deal - its only neighbor is 1. You can only get to 1 one way
so you can only get to 4 1 way - store it in ways[4]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
5 – same deal, ways[5] = 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
6 - now six is different. It has 2 neighbors - 5 and 4. You can get to
5 one way and 4 one way so we can get to 6 two ways (the sum of the
ways to get to each of it&amp;#39;s neighbors). Store that in ways[6]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Go through all the nodes and then ways[the last node] will have your
answer:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;

&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;ways&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;{}
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; d &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; data:
    ways[d]&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; d &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; data[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;:]:
    neighbors &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; rmap[d]
    sum &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; n &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; neighbors:
        sum &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; sum &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; ways[n]
    ways[d]&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Relatively straightforward and lightning fast. Dynamic programming
can be really hard to teach but I think this problem might be a good
one to do with an advanced data structures class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For comparison, you can find the clojure code &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/advent2020/blob/main/src/day10.clj&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fun problem today. Looking forward to tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Teacher looks at Advent of Code 2020 - Days 7 and 8</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day0708/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2020 14:47:17 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day0708/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Today we&amp;#39;ll talk about days &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/7&#34;&gt;seven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/8&#34;&gt;eight&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s start with 7. I teach all morning on Mondays. I woke up and
worked out and then took a look at the problem in the few minutes
before class. It was certainly harder than days one through six but I
felt it was something I knew I could do based on past experience so I
quickly started to throw something together. I tried to finish it in
the between classes but couldn&amp;#39;t get the right answer to part
one. After class I spent more time debugging. I was pretty certain my
algorithm was right and it turns out it was. The problem was in my
parsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyway, to the problem. Read it over if you haven&amp;#39;t yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you&amp;#39;ve studied data structures and algorithms you&amp;#39;ll recognize that
this problem can be viewed as a graph problem. Bags are nodes in the
graph and edges tell you what bags each bag can contain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The data is set up to represent a graph like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img width=&#34;50%&#34; src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/advent2020-0708/g1.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I left out the weights (numbers of bags). This can be represented in
an adjacency list. The video does this in Clojure but in Python, you&amp;#39;d
get something that starts like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;{&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;lightred&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;     : [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;brightwhite&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;mutedyellow&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;],
 &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;darkorange&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;   : [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;brightwhite&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;mutedyellow&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;],
 &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;brightwhite&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;  : [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;shinygold&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;],
 &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;mutedyellow&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;  : [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;shinygold&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;fadedblue&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;],
 &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;shinygold&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;    :[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;darkolive&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;vibrantplum&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;],
 &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;darkolive&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;    :[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;fadedblue&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;dottedblack&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;],
 &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;vibtrantplum&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; :[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;fadedblue&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;dottedblack&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;]}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The challenge comes when you see that many starting points can lead to
the goal of the shiny gold bag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The insight comes when you notice that you can &amp;#34;reverse the edges.&amp;#34;
For example, when we saw the line that led to the lightred contains
brightwhite and mutedyellow, instead we represent it the other way
making two entries - brightwhite is contained by lightred and also
mutedyellow is contained by lightred. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Once we set this up the solution is a breadth or depth first search. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The video doesn&amp;#39;t do a complet walk through but goes into more
details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I like this type of problem for classes because students can see that
sometimes changing the data can make the problem much easier. If you
implement the adjacency list as it&amp;#39;s presented the problem seems
hard. Once you see you can go from shinygold out instead of from  all
the bags to shinygold the porblem becomes much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The other interesting point is that without fundamental data
structures and algorithms this is a hard problem. With them, it&amp;#39;s
pretty straightforward. Remind your students of this when they ask why
they need data structures and algorithms. This problem might be made
up but graphs represent a lot of things in the real world and graph
traversals and algorithms can solve a lot of real world problems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now to day 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Day 8 involved a simple machine simulator and leads to a very
straightforward solution - write a program that simulates the computer
stated in the problem. My solution tries to approach the problem in a
functional way and also makes use of a function lookup table to avoid
multiple ifs. The solution and complete walk through is in the video
and in Clojure but a similar solution can be written in Python.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Teacher looks at Advent of Code 2020 - Day 06</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day06/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 06 Dec 2020 10:14:03 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day06/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/6&#34;&gt;Day 6&lt;/a&gt; turned out to be pretty straightforward. Like day 4 you had to
deal with two consecutive newlines when parsing the data but assuming
you did day 4 that&amp;#39;s no problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The gist is that a group is formed by consecutive lines and groups are
separated by a blank line. Each line in each group is a string of
letters representing answers to questions. For instance, for this
group: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;example&#34;&gt;
abc
abd
ab
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
you have three people. The first answered &amp;#39;yes&amp;#39; to a, b, and c. the
second to a,b, and d and the third to a and b. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Your goal was to figure out how many different questions did each
group answer &amp;#39;yes&amp;#39; to and what was the total across the groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It seemed that the easiest thing to do was to take each group, remove
the newlines and then count the unique characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In Python, something like this (Clojure in the video and on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/advent2020/blob/main/src/day06.clj&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;d&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;abc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;abd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;ab&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
d &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; d&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;replace(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)
s &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; set(d)
ans &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; len(s)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, you just have to do that for each group and add them all up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part 2 added a small twist. Now you wanted to look at each group and
count the number of answers that everyone in that group answered &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34;
to. For the above example, it would be 2 - everyone answered a and b.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Assuming your language supports set operations, you can just use
union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Again in Python: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;d &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;abc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;abd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;ab&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
d_list &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; d&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;split()
result &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; set(d_list[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;])

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; item &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; d_list[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;:]:
    result &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; result &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; set(item)
print(result)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Again,  do it for all the groups and add it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a great question to go over set operations!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Check out the Clojure video for that approach where I also talk about
easier ways to complete yesterday&amp;#39;s problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A teacher looks at Advent of Code 2020 - Day 5</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day05/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 05 Dec 2020 11:18:59 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day05/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/5&#34;&gt;Day five&amp;#39;s problem&lt;/a&gt; is a nice one for an early CS class. It can be very
much brute forced but it also touches on some nice concepts and can be
solved pretty elegantly. I&amp;#39;ve embedded a walk through in Clojure at
the end but a Python solution would be pretty similar.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Read the problem over if you haven&amp;#39;t. At it&amp;#39;s core you are taking a boarding
pass representing a coded airplane seat number and you&amp;#39;re converting
it to a known seat (row and column). The encoding scheme uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning&#34;&gt;binary
space partitioning&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/5&#34;&gt;question statement&lt;/a&gt; goes over the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of the first things to notice is that you should separate the pass
into two parts - the row, which consists of the first seven characters
each one being an &lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt; or a &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; and the last three which are the
columns and they are marked with either a &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt; or an &lt;strong&gt;L&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, the sample pass &lt;strong&gt;FBFBBFFRLR&lt;/strong&gt; separates into &lt;strong&gt;FBFBBFF&lt;/strong&gt; for the row
and &lt;strong&gt;RLR&lt;/strong&gt; for the clumn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are 128 rows numbered 0 through 127 so you start with 127 (the
back of the plane) and then depending on if the next character is an
&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt; or a &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; you either subtract out half the range size or you
don&amp;#39;t. If the character is an &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; you don&amp;#39;t since you&amp;#39;re at the back
of the section and the back rows are higher. If it&amp;#39;s a &lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt; you do
since you&amp;#39;re at the front and front rows have lower numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, the first &lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt; says you&amp;#39;re at the front so you subtract &lt;strong&gt;half&lt;/strong&gt; the
range and now you&amp;#39;re looking at 0-63. The next character is a &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; so
you don&amp;#39;t subtract anything but you&amp;#39;ll be next looking at 32 through
63 etc. The question has a full walk through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Looking at the  row string, you have &lt;strong&gt;FBFBBFF&lt;/strong&gt;. If we substitute the
amount we subtract for the letters we get &lt;code&gt;64 0 16 0 0 2 1&lt;/code&gt; or the
place values of a binary number &lt;strong&gt;in reverse&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In my solution, I reversed the string and then converted each &lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;
into a number. A &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; became a 0 and an &lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt; became 2^i where &lt;strong&gt;i&lt;/strong&gt; is the
location (index) in the string. For the sample string, once reversed
to &lt;strong&gt;FFBBFBF&lt;/strong&gt; it gives &lt;code&gt;1 2 0 0 16 0 64&lt;/code&gt;. If we sum those up and
subtract from 127 we get our row number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We basically can do the same thing for the column but there you
subtract from 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part 1 of the question asks you to map the row and column to a final
number by calcualing &lt;code&gt;row*8+col&lt;/code&gt; and then find the highest seat number
from a give list of boarding passes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part 2 requires you look through all the boarding passes to determine
your actual seat - the one seat missing from the data set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Lots of good stuff for a class in this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You&amp;#39;ve got the basic data parsing as usual but I love that this can be
brute forced but by noticing the base 2 nature of the data you can
write up a number of different elegant solutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s a complete solution coded up in Clojure. You can also check all
my Advent of Code solutions up on GitHub

      <title>A Teacher Looks at Advent of Code 2020 - Day 4</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
One of the nice things about Advent of Code is that it gets me to
explore language features I haven&amp;#39;t used yet. Today&amp;#39;s problem got me
to explore Clojure Spec which is a very cool validation
library. There&amp;#39;s a complete run through of the solution in Clojure in
the video but here I&amp;#39;ll talk about the problem in Python (mostly). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/4&#34;&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; is about validating passports. You start with a text
file consisting of passport information. Each passport is one or more
lines with each line having a bunch of key value pairs. For example,
these two lines represent a passport for someone who&amp;#39;s eye color (ecl)
is gray (gry) and who was born (byr) in 1937:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;example&#34;&gt;
ecl:gry pid:860033327 eyr:2020 hcl:#fffffd
byr:1937 iyr:2017 cid:147 hgt:183cm
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The catch is that one passport can span multiple lines and that
passports are separated by two consecutive newlines in the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A passport has 8 field types with one, Country of Origin (cid) being
optional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For part 1, a valid passport is one that contains all 7 required
fields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The video goes over a Clojure solution which, I think is cleaner but
the idea is the same as the Python I&amp;#39;ll talk about here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Splitting the data into a list of potential passports is easy because
you can split the string on two newlines: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;data &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; open(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;../data/sample04.dat&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;read()
data&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;split(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\n\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now we have a list of string. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next, we can split each string on whitespace so that each string in
each sublist is a string in the form &lt;strong&gt;k:v&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;data_list &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; []
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; d &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; data:
    data_list&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;append([item &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; item &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; d&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;split()])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, for example, data_list[0] might look like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;example&#34;&gt;
[&amp;#39;ecl:gry&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;pid:860033327&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;eyr:2020&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;hcl:#fffffd&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;byr:1937&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;iyr:2017&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;cid:147&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;hgt:183cm&amp;#39;]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, we can convert each passport into a dictionary: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;data_dicts&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;[]
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; d &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; data_list:
    temp &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; { item&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;split(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;]:item&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;split(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;] &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; item &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; d} 
    temp&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;pop(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;cid&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;)
    data_dicts&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;append(temp)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The easiest way I came up with to check if a passport was valid was to
make a set out of a list of required field names, make a set out of
each potential passports field names (they&amp;#39;re dictionary keys) and see
if they&amp;#39;re equal: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;fields &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; set([&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;byr&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;iyr&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;eyr&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;hgt&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;hcl&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;ecl&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;pid&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;])
valid_passports &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;  [set(x&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;keys()) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; fields &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; x &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; data_dicts]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think the Clojure code is cleaner but it&amp;#39;s much the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part two added a twist - you now have to not only see if the required
fields are there but you had to make sure they had valid data. For
example, height had to start with a positive integer followed by
either &lt;strong&gt;cm&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;in&lt;/strong&gt;. If it was &lt;strong&gt;cm&lt;/strong&gt;, the number had to be in a certain
range and if it was &lt;strong&gt;in&lt;/strong&gt; it had to be within a different range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This didn&amp;#39;t sound hard but could get tricky. For each field type you
could write a function that took in the value and returned true or
false depending on its validity - lots of ad hoc code. You could then
loop over all the passports and test to see if all the conditions were
met. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It turns out that Clojure has a really cool library - Clojure Spec
that does just that. You set up validators for each field type and
then one for an entire passport. Here&amp;#39;s the code: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-clojure&#34; data-lang=&#34;clojure&#34;&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::byr&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/and&lt;/span&gt; string? &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;(&amp;gt;= (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;u/parse-int&lt;/span&gt; %) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1920&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;(&amp;lt;= (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;u/parse-int&lt;/span&gt; %) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2002&lt;/span&gt;)))
(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::iyr&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/and&lt;/span&gt; string? &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;(&amp;gt;= (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;u/parse-int&lt;/span&gt; %) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2010&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;(&amp;lt;= (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;u/parse-int&lt;/span&gt; %) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2020&lt;/span&gt;)))
(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::eyr&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/and&lt;/span&gt; string? &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;(&amp;gt;= (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;u/parse-int&lt;/span&gt; %) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2020&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;(&amp;lt;= (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;u/parse-int&lt;/span&gt; %) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2030&lt;/span&gt;)))
(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::hgt&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/and&lt;/span&gt; string? hgt-test))
(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::hcl&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/and&lt;/span&gt; string? &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;(re-find &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;#[0-9a-f]{6}&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; %)))
(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::ecl&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/and&lt;/span&gt; string? &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;(re-find &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;amb|blu|brn|gry|grn|hzl|oth&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; %)))
(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::pid&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/and&lt;/span&gt; string? &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;(re-find &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;^[0-9]{9}$&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; % )))
(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::cid&lt;/span&gt; string?)
(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::passport&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/keys&lt;/span&gt;
                   &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;:req&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::byr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::iyr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::eyr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::hgt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::hcl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::ecl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::pid&lt;/span&gt;]
                   &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;:opt&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::cid&lt;/span&gt;]))

(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s/valid?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;::passport&lt;/span&gt; test-passport)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The last line would test to see if &lt;strong&gt;test-passport&lt;/strong&gt; was valid. It&amp;#39;s all
covered in detail in the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Clojure spec wasn&amp;#39;t required for this problem but I&amp;#39;ve been meaning to
play with it for a while and it led to a clean and elegant way of
testing passports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not sure if I&amp;#39;ll get to more posts or even solve more problems - I&amp;#39;m
trying to limit my own screen time over the weekends but we&amp;#39;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <title>A Teacher Looks at Advent of Code 2020 - Day 3</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/advent-2020-day03/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I thought I&amp;#39;d do a video for today. No particular reason. Mostly why
not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ll talk about day 3&amp;#39;s problem and code up a solution in Clojure. If
you haven&amp;#39;t ever used Clojure, hopefully this will give a bit of the
flavor. This video also serves double duty as being my next Using
Emacs video since it demos Emacs&amp;#39;s Clojure tools. Mostly Cider which
even with a few quirks is the best development environment I&amp;#39;ve ever
used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;ll do any more videos or blog posts on AOC this
year. I hope to but I&amp;#39;m going to have to get to end of semester
obligations soon so you never know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Emacs 75 - Bufler</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-75-bufler/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Sep 2020 13:17:41 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-75-bufler/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Quick Emacs hit today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After my last video, I received a comment noting that I was using
ibuffer and that there was another package I might want to consider -
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/alphapapa/bufler.el&#34;&gt;bufler&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I started with basic ibuffer and then started to &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-34-ibuffer-emmet/&#34;&gt;customize it&lt;/a&gt; to group
buffers but that was always somewhat finicky. More often than not I
couldn&amp;#39;t tune it the way I wanted. Most recently, I started using
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/purcell/ibuffer-projectile&#34;&gt;ibuffer-projectile&lt;/a&gt; which group projects for me but lost the other
customizations. In any event, I was more or less happy with things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/alphapapa/bufler.el&#34;&gt;Bufler&lt;/a&gt; though looks to be a nice alternative. Out of the box it looks
like it groups things pretty well and has a nice Emacs &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra&#34;&gt;hydra&lt;/a&gt; that you
can bring up with &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; to remind you how to do things like kill one or
more buffers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Right now, I&amp;#39;m using it as an ibuffer replacement but it also has its
own version of switch buffer that I plan to play with as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The only knit I&amp;#39;ve found thus far is that when you run bufler, it
splits the window and lists the buffers in the new space. If I&amp;#39;m using
ibuffer I want it to use the whole Emacs frame. Otherwise I just use
ivy-switch-buffer (or now bufler-switch-buffer). I couldn&amp;#39;t figure out
a way built in so ended up writing a small function: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-lisp&#34; data-lang=&#34;lisp&#34;&gt;(defun mz/bufler-one-window (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;optional&lt;/span&gt; force-refresh)
  (interactive &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;P&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)
  (bufler-list)
  (delete-other-windows)

)

(global-set-key (kbd &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;C-x C-b&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;mz/bufler-one-window&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Using Emacs 74 Eglot</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-74-eglot/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 31 Aug 2020 13:03:14 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-74-eglot/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I primarily program in four languages these days -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clojure &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And most of the time, my Emacs configuration has handled each one
differently. Cider for Clojure, Irony for C++, Elpy and Jedi for
Python and Java I could never figure out. This is of course on top of
tools that work across languages like company for completions, or
flycheck for general language syntax checking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A while ago I heard about lsp-mode - Language Server Protocol
mode. Basically, you set up the mode and it connects to back end
language servers. The idea is to keep configuration down and provide a
consistent interface across langauges while leveraging the types of
support these back ends can provide. I wrote a bit about lsp-mode and
made a video and you can find it &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-58-lsp-mode/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I first tried LSP it just didn&amp;#39;t work. I tried it again later and
it basically worked but was finicky. Configuration took more work than
I wanted, particularly for customizing per language and even when
working it didn&amp;#39;t work as expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This past summer, I had to teach using Java so I tried lsp-mode
again. Setup wasn&amp;#39;t too bad and most of the issues were more related
to Java than to lsp-mode but I didn&amp;#39;t like the results. While it might
be great for the professional developer there were too many popups and
made the screen way too busy for teaching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Still, the idea of a single simple configuration was enticing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, when I decided to get my configuration together for the Fall
semester I decided to try yet again and discovered &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot&#34;&gt;eglot&lt;/a&gt; for
Emacs. Eglot turned out to be easier to install and gave me more of
the experience I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To start, I set it up for C++ using&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-text&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;(use-package eglot :ensure t)
(add-to-list &amp;#39;eglot-server-programs &amp;#39;((c++-mode c-mode) &amp;#34;clangd-10&amp;#34;))
(add-hook &amp;#39;c-mode-hook &amp;#39;eglot-ensure)
(add-hook &amp;#39;c++-mode-hook &amp;#39;eglot-ensure)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Eglot defaults to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls&#34;&gt;ccls&lt;/a&gt; as a C++ language server. I didn&amp;#39;t want to have
to build it but was able to &lt;code&gt;apt-get install clangd-10&lt;/code&gt; and use that
instead by adding clangd-10 to the eglot-server-programs in the second
configuration line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For python I had to install &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/palantir/python-language-server&#34;&gt;pyls&lt;/a&gt;, the Python Language Server but that
was easy to do and then I just had to add &lt;code&gt;(add-hook &amp;#39;python-mode-hook
&amp;#39;eglot-ensure)&lt;/code&gt; to my config.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, Java was more of an issue I had to get &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls&#34;&gt;eclipse.jdt.ls&lt;/a&gt; on my
system. It turns out that lsp-mode installed it for me already so I
just had to point to it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-text&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;(defconst my-eclipse-jdt-home &amp;#34;/home/zamansky/.emacs.d/.cache/lsp/eclipse.jdt.ls/plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.5.800.v20200727-1323.jar&amp;#34;)
(defun my-eglot-eclipse-jdt-contact (interactive)
  &amp;#34;Contact with the jdt server input INTERACTIVE.&amp;#34;
  (let ((cp (getenv &amp;#34;CLASSPATH&amp;#34;)))
    (setenv &amp;#34;CLASSPATH&amp;#34; (concat cp &amp;#34;:&amp;#34; my-eclipse-jdt-home))
    (unwind-protect (eglot--eclipse-jdt-contact nil)
      (setenv &amp;#34;CLASSPATH&amp;#34; cp))))
(setcdr (assq &amp;#39;java-mode eglot-server-programs) #&amp;#39;my-eglot-eclipse-jdt-contact)
(add-hook &amp;#39;java-mode-hook &amp;#39;eglot-ensure)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So far, I&amp;#39;m liking eglot very much. I&amp;#39;ll probably check lsp-mode out
again somewhere down the line but as of now it&amp;#39;s Cider for Clojure and
Eglot for everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The video has a run through and demo. Check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Emacs 73 - Ripgrep and updating the blog</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-72-rg/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Jun 2020 11:58:11 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-72-rg/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
As I said in my &lt;a href=&#34;As I mentioned in my &#34;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#39;m moving to a new Hugo theme. I decided
on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mitrichius/hugo-theme-anubis&#34;&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s simple and clean. Unfortunately, in this change over,
many things broke. Specifically, all my embedded html. Using earlier
version of Hugo I could directly embed HTML and it would render. Now I
have to bracket the HTML with special org markup - &lt;strong&gt;#+begin_export html&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;#+end_export html&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;example&#34;&gt;
#+begin_export html
&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;html stuff to render goes in here &amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
#+end_export
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Minimally I had to find all my embedded videos and all my embedded
Tweets. There&amp;#39;s probably a lot more. Fortunately with Emacs this is
pretty easy. I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dajva/rg.el&#34;&gt;rg.el&lt;/a&gt; which is an Emacs front end to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep&#34;&gt;ripgrep&lt;/a&gt;. If
you don&amp;#39;t know ripgrep, it&amp;#39;s kind of like a super fast, super enhanced grep on
steroids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In Emacs, I was able to do a ripgrep search which created a buffer
containing all the embedded html fragments from all my blog posts
across all the directories. I then used Emacs&amp;#39; &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mhayashi1120/Emacs-wgrep&#34;&gt;wgrep&lt;/a&gt; feature which
allowed me to edit that combined buffer and save all the results back
to the original files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All in all it just took a few minutes. There are still some things I
have to clean up from older posts but at least the site is workable now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Check out the video for a walkthrough:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Emacs 72 - Customizing Elfeed</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-72-customizing-elfeed/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 May 2020 14:47:59 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-72-customizing-elfeed/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I made this video write after I made the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-71-openwith/&#34;&gt;openwith&lt;/a&gt; one so even though
I don&amp;#39;t mention anything in this video, I wanted to share some updates
on dired and openwith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I got a lot of suggestions on alternate ways to achieve the workflow I
was seeking - being able to open a file using an external viewer. One
person noted that under newer versions of Emacs, the &lt;code&gt;W&lt;/code&gt; key is bound
to the command &lt;code&gt;(browse-url-of-dired-file)&lt;/code&gt; which does exactly what I
wanted. Problem solved with no customizing or extra packages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s a good thing I got a solution when I did - I needed it. I&amp;#39;ve been
reviewing applications for my new Teacher Certification program. It&amp;#39;s
a 21 credit graduate program that results in participants receiving a
brand spanking new New York State Computer Science teaching
license. The applications consist of a bunch of files incuding PDFs,
images (photos), doc and text files and source code samples. I&amp;#39;ve got
all the applications in a Google drive which I&amp;#39;ve downloaded and now I
can just drop into dired and go through each directory, hit &lt;code&gt;enter&lt;/code&gt; for
source code and it&amp;#39;s loaded in an Emacs buffer and &lt;code&gt;W&lt;/code&gt; for everything
else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now for today&amp;#39;s video. It&amp;#39;s about a small customization I made to the
elfeed RSS reader. It&amp;#39;s also about the advantages and limitations of
Emacs built in documentation. I&amp;#39;m not particularly strong in elisp -
I&amp;#39;m a dabbler at best but even so, using Emac&amp;#39;s built in help I was
able to get to elisp code that was very close to what I wanted to do
and then customize it. It also looks at the limitations - there still
some code that I looked at that I have no clue as to what it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Specifically, elfeed lets you open a link in an external brower by
hitting &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;. That&amp;#39;s how I like reading most of my feeds. I&amp;#39;ll scroll
up and down and hit &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; for what I want to read. The trouble is that
when you hit &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; focus goes to the browser and at the same time,
elfeed marks the entry as read and advances. I want it not to mark as
read. After I made the video, I decided I also didn&amp;#39;t want elfeed to
advance to the next story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s what I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I went in to elfeed and instead of typing &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; on an entry, I ran
&lt;code&gt;(describe-key&lt;/code&gt;)~ which is bound to &lt;code&gt;C-h k&lt;/code&gt;. I then typed &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; which
revealed that it ran &lt;code&gt;elfeed-search-browse-url&lt;/code&gt;. I followed the
hyperlinks in the help to open &lt;code&gt;elfeed-search.el&lt;/code&gt; and found the
function. From there I just copied it over to my Emacs config, tweaked
it and voila, problem solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The video has all the details. Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Emacs 71 Openwith</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-71-openwith/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 May 2020 11:45:39 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-71-openwith/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I spend most of my time in Emacs but still use the shell and browser
for some things. One of the things I use my shell for is to launch
libreoffice to view and edit docx files and spreadsheets, evince for
pdf files and imagemagick for image files. Yes, I know I can view all
of these in Emacs but there are a few limitations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emacs chokes on large files&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t edit the docx file or the image&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I hop to the shell and launch the program I need on the files in
question. It&amp;#39;s fine but it does mean I end up with two windows for
each operation - the terminal from which I run, say, libreoffice and
libreoffice itself. I will also have my browser and one ore more Emacs
windows open so things can get a bit cluttered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, on the Emacs side, one tool that I still haven&amp;#39;t gotten myself to
regularly use is dired. I figured dired could be made to do what I
want - quickly and easily launch programs to view and edit my files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By default, dired opens files in a new Emacs buffer. That&amp;#39;s fine for
text files but not the behavior I want for docx and other files. It
turns out there are a number of good solutions. The one that I&amp;#39;ll
likely stick with is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jpkotta/openwith/tree/1dc89670822966fab6e656f6519fdd7f01e8301a&#34;&gt;openwith&lt;/a&gt; but there are other options as
well. Check out the video for more:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Emacs 70 Org Protocol</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-70-org-protocol/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Mar 2020 15:15:28 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-70-org-protocol/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I spent part of today cleaning up my Emacs workflow. Specifically, how
I capture emails and links into org-mode&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I already wrote about how I used org-capture (&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-23-capture-1/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-24-capture-2/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). It&amp;#39;s
pretty clean and easy but there was one thing that always nagged at
me. When I capture from mu4e within Emacs by hitting &lt;code&gt;C-c m&lt;/code&gt; it&amp;#39;s set
up to automatically populate the capture template with a link to the
email labelled with the email&amp;#39;s subject. When I do it from Gmail or
to store a web link as a bookmark, I have to copy and paste the link
in manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That&amp;#39;s where &lt;a href=&#34;https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html&#34;&gt;org-protocol&lt;/a&gt; comes in. We can use org-protocol to link
between a browser and Emacs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First you have to run Emacs as a server. You can start the Emacs
server using &lt;code&gt;(server-start)&lt;/code&gt; but I always run emacs using a shortcut
key bound to &lt;code&gt;emacsclient -c -a &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/code&gt;. This runs emacsclient and
connects to my running Emacs server but if the server isn&amp;#39;t running it
starts it. That meant that I only had to add &lt;code&gt;(require &amp;#39;org-protocol)&lt;/code&gt;
to my Emacs config file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I followed the instructions in the documentation by typing in these
lines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;gconftool-2 -s /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/org-protocol/command &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;/usr/local/bin/emacsclient %s&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; --type String

gconftool-2 -s /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/org-protocol/enabled --type Boolean true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
but that didn&amp;#39;t seem to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I ended up following the instructions I found in &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7464951/how-to-make-org-protocol-work&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; creating a
file named &lt;code&gt;org-protocol.desktop&lt;/code&gt; in the folder
 &lt;code&gt;~/.local/share/applications&lt;/code&gt; containing:
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;Desktop Entry&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
Name&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;org-protocol
Exec&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;emacsclient %u
Type&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;Application
Terminal&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;false
Categories&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;System;
MimeType&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;x-scheme-handler/org-protocol;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and then running &lt;code&gt;update-desktop-database
~/.local/share/applications/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This seemed to do the trick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also modified my link capture template: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-lisp&#34; data-lang=&#34;lisp&#34;&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;l&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Link&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; entry (file+headline &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;~/Sync/orgfiles/links.org&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Links&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)
                    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;* %a %^g\n %?\n %T\n %i&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, to get things basically to work, I installed &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sprig/org-capture-extension&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;
extension. I configured it to use my &amp;#34;l&amp;#34; or link capture
template. Once everything was installed I went to a web site and
clicked the plugin. I was popped into Emacs with the capture template
up and filled in. I did it again, this time marking text and hitting
the button and again everything worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Looking at the template, the &lt;code&gt;%a&lt;/code&gt; is replaced by the web page link,
the &lt;code&gt;%i&lt;/code&gt; with the marked text, the &lt;code&gt;%T&lt;/code&gt; with the timestamp and the
cursor is left at the &lt;code&gt;%?&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I wanted to make one more change. I wanted to also use this for
storing Gmail links. The problem was that I wanted my links to be
sored in a file named &lt;code&gt;links.org&lt;/code&gt; while I wanted my Gmails stored
under my main org file &lt;code&gt;i.org&lt;/code&gt;. By reading the org-protocol page I
found that I could just create a bookmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Copied mostly from the docs, I made a bookmark with this as the link
(all in one line):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;javascript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;location&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;org-protocol://capture://m/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
      encodeURIComponent(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;location&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
      encodeURIComponent(document.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
      encodeURIComponent(window.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;getSelection&lt;/span&gt;())&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It worked perfectly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This time I used this as the template:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-lisp&#34; data-lang=&#34;lisp&#34;&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;m&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Mail To Do&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; entry (file+headline &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;~/Sync/orgfiles/i.org&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;To Do and Notes&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;* TODO %a\n %?&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;:prepend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That&amp;#39;s it. Now I can store emails in Emacs or Gmail as well as
bookmarks without any cut and paste. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s a video with the walkthrough:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Using Emacs 69 Floobits</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-69-floobits/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 21 Mar 2020 10:52:37 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-69-floobits/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hunter, like most other schools has gone remote. I taught my first two
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teaching-online-day-01/&#34;&gt;online classes&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday. Currently, I&amp;#39;m using Zoom for synchronous
stuff and a mailing list and slack for async. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are still some missing pieces. When we&amp;#39;re all together, it&amp;#39;s
easy to look at a student&amp;#39;s work and talk them through issues. It&amp;#39;s
also easy to get students to work together, at least to a point. With
everyone locked up in their own homes, real time collaboration is
harder. Sure, we can use tools like GitHub issues and pull requests
for async code commentary but what about live help and pairing? If
we want to use an online environment, &lt;a href=&#34;https://repl.it&#34;&gt;repl.it&lt;/a&gt;  - a platform I very
much like fits the bill. On the other hand, what do you use if you
want to work collaboratively in real time using a local editor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That&amp;#39;s where &lt;a href=&#34;https://floobits.com&#34;&gt;Floobits&lt;/a&gt; comes in. Floobits is a platform that provides
for collaborative live editing. It works with Emacs, Neovim, Sublime
Text, Atom, and IntelliJ (and maybe all the Jetbrains IDEs). They
support a free tier which only has public workspaces but that&amp;#39;s fine,
as far as I&amp;#39;m concerned, for educational purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Check out the video to see how I set it up:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Emacs Episode 68 - Tramp and org-publish</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-68-tramp-org-publish/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 14 Mar 2020 20:57:08 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-68-tramp-org-publish/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I maintain a couple of small simple web sites. One provides
information about my undergraduate &lt;a href=&#34;http://info.huntercs.org/scholars/&#34;&gt;honors CS program&lt;/a&gt; and another that
isn&amp;#39;t live yet is a FAQ for my &lt;a href=&#34;http://info.huntercs.org/teacher_ed/faq.html&#34;&gt;CS teacher certification program&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Traditionally I would use ssh to connect to the host machine, fire up
Emacs and edit the html files to update the sites. I always forget
that with Emacs we can do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One way is with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TrampMode&#34;&gt;Tramp Mode&lt;/a&gt;. I was reminded of this by JCS&amp;#39;s recent
&lt;a href=&#34;https://irreal.org/blog/?p=8705&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;. With Tramp, you can open a file on a remote host and edit it in
place. This means I get my full Emacs config but am editing the file
over there!!! It&amp;#39;s very slick but I always forget about it even though
I had already made &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-25-tramp/&#34;&gt;a video on it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tramp is cool but I was still editing the html directly. I figured it
would be easier to just use org-mode but that required figuring out
how to make the html produced by org-mode look nice. Fortunately, it&amp;#39;s
not hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We can turn off the default CSS used by org-mode
using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-org&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-org&#34; data-lang=&#34;org&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;#+OPTIONS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;: html-style:nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Or if we want add custom CSS using one or more of these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-org&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-org&#34; data-lang=&#34;org&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;#+HTML_HEAD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;: &amp;lt;link rel=&amp;#34;stylesheet&amp;#34; type=&amp;#34;text/css&amp;#34; href=&amp;#34;style1.css&amp;#34; /&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;#+HTML_HEAD_EXTRA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;: &amp;lt;link rel=&amp;#34;alternate stylesheet&amp;#34; type=&amp;#34;text/css&amp;#34; href=&amp;#34;style2.css&amp;#34; /&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We can also embed html and custom CSS in our org-files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://orgmode.org/manual/CSS-support.html&#34;&gt;This page&lt;/a&gt; from the org-mode documentation also lists many of the html
components that are styled by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Armed with custom CSS we can use the org-mode exporting facilities to
convert the file to a web page but the final step is to use
&lt;a href=&#34;https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-publish-html-tutorial.html&#34;&gt;org-publish&lt;/a&gt;. This lets us export one or more org-mode files and save
the result in some specified directory. You can also publish static
files like CSS files and images to go with the org to html
files. Finally by using the tramp syntax we can publish to a remote
host. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The goes through all of this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Emacs Episode 67 - Emacs vs Vi a rant with some historical perspective</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-67-emacs-rant/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2020 07:57:08 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-67-emacs-rant/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been meaning to do my version of the Emacs VI rant for a while. A
few years ago I staged out a video showing what it would be like for a
beginner to start with Emacs, Vim, Atom, and Sublime Text but decided
it would be long, unwieldy and clunky to present - particularly when
it came to customization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I tabled it for a while but recently have been seeing a bunch of
threads, videos and posts talking about Emacs and Vim. Some are really
well done, balanced and sensible like Derek Taylor&amp;#39;s over on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaBdlcYaZLQ&#34;&gt;DistroTube&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, I saw plenty of what makes me
nuts. People claiming things like style is objectively better than
the other or was created with speed or ergonomics in mind so is
superior and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s my take. I think it&amp;#39;s a little different than some of the other
rants because I look a bit at history and evolution and also at the
day to day reality of editing. Hope you enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Emacs 66 - an eshell switcher in elisp</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-66-eshell-elisp/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Feb 2020 08:12:22 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-66-eshell-elisp/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I thought it was time to give &lt;a href=&#34;https://masteringemacs.org/article/complete-guide-mastering-eshell&#34;&gt;eshell&lt;/a&gt; in Emacs another try. It has some
pretty cool features but for whatever reason, I&amp;#39;ve never really been
able to adopt Emacs as my go to shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Eshell out of the box is pretty cool but could use some
enhancements. When launching at login it doesn&amp;#39;t know about the path
you set in your .bashrc or .zshrc in my case files. It just seemed to
have problems with paths in general but that was fixed with the
exce-path-from-shell package. The prompt also needed some fixing up
along with some other tweaks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/manateelazycat/aweshell&#34;&gt;aweshell&lt;/a&gt; which looked promising but it wasn&amp;#39;t on melpa so I
had to clone it separately. I also noticed that it basically tied
together some packages I could download myself and added a shell
switcher but didn&amp;#39;t bind the keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I thought I&amp;#39;d dive into elisp -something I haven&amp;#39;t done in a while to
write my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s my current complete eshell config:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-elisp&#34; data-lang=&#34;elisp&#34;&gt;(use-package exec-path-from-shell
  :ensure &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;
  :config
  (exec-path-from-shell-initialize))


    (use-package fish-completion
    :ensure &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;
    :config
    (global-fish-completion-mode))
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;;; (use-package eshell-prompt-extras &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;;; :ensure t&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;;; :config&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;;; (setq epe-show-python-info nil)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;;; )&lt;/span&gt;

  (use-package eshell-git-prompt
  :ensure &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;
  :config
  (eshell-git-prompt-use-theme &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;git-radar&lt;/span&gt;)
  )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And here&amp;#39;s the code I ended up with for my shell switcher:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-elisp&#34; data-lang=&#34;elisp&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;cl-lib&lt;/span&gt;)
  (defun select-or-create (arg)
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Commentary ARG.&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
    (if (string= arg &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;New eshell&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)
        (eshell &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;)
      (switch-to-buffer arg)))
  (defun eshell-switcher (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;optional&lt;/span&gt; arg)
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Commentary ARG.&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;

            (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; (select-or-create (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;completing-read&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Select Shell:&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;cons&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;New eshell&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; names)))))))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I currently bound eshell-switcher to &lt;code&gt;CTRL-z e&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Using Emacs 65 - Live Python</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-65-live-python/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2020 13:13:09 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-65-live-python/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The other day I stumbled upon Emacs&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/donkirkby/live-py-plugin&#34;&gt;Live Coding&lt;/a&gt; plugin. It takes
interactive coding up to the next level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Normally, when you code Python, if you&amp;#39;re working in a REPL, every
time you hit &amp;lt;Enter&amp;gt; the line you just typed is evaluated. When you&amp;#39;re
working ina source file, you&amp;#39;re just editing until you send the file
into a Python interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With this module, your file is continually evaluated as you type and
it shows you the results in a side window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you type in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;a &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;
b &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;
c &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; a &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; b
print(c&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;c)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The live python window will display something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;a &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;
b &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;
c &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;
print(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you change one of the variables, everything updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It gets even cooler when you add loops, functions, and even recursion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s also support for unit testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It works, to varying degrees with Emacs, PyCharmm, Sublime Text and
there&amp;#39;s even a browser version. Emacs handles the basics and it seems
that the Sublime Text version adds support for some graphing. PyCharm
has that plus turtle graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While this is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; cool, to be honest, I don&amp;#39;t know how useful this
is going to be but I&amp;#39;m very excited to play with it in the Fall when
I&amp;#39;ll be teaching Python again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Check out this short video to see it in action:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Emacs 64 - Notmuch</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-64-notmuch/</link>

      <description>
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been using the gmail web interface for a long time. My first
email or at least the oldest one still in the system dates back to Oct
18, 2004 7:29am. It was a letter to a buddy about an indoor turkey
fryer and if he needed a lift to Fairway the following morning to
shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before that, I used my &lt;a href=&#34;http://panix.com&#34;&gt;Panix&lt;/a&gt; shell account - probably with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_%2528email_client%2529&#34;&gt;PINE&lt;/a&gt;. Work
email was using my own servers at Stuy along with either PINE or Emacs
using VM mode which has long been deprecated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I haven&amp;#39;t bitten the bullet and left gmail yet but I thought it was
time to move my personal email over to an Emacs client. I currently
use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/&#34;&gt;MU4E&lt;/a&gt; and am pretty happy with it but figured I&amp;#39;d give another
contender a try - &lt;a href=&#34;https://notmuchmail.org/&#34;&gt;Notmuch&lt;/a&gt;. Both rely on some other backend to pull
email form an imap server. I&amp;#39;m currently using mbsync. I&amp;#39;m not
thrilled with it but then, I&amp;#39;m not thrilled with offlineimap which is,
as best I can figure the only other alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the video I&amp;#39;ll show a bit about notmuch and how it comapres to
mu4e. Both are nice packages and I&amp;#39;d love one email client that
combined the best of both and maybe added a bit more shine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At their cores, both mu4e and notmuch are built on top of &lt;a href=&#34;https://xapian.org/&#34;&gt;xapain&lt;/a&gt; and
leverage search to manage your emails. Here are a few of the key
differences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Mu4e
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Folder based&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easier to handle separate email accounts (and keep them separate)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better org-mode integration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automatically calls your IMAP sync program&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes things on the server (moves, deletes etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
Notmuch
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tags based&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t touch or change anything on the serer (doesn&amp;#39;t delete or
move things there, just tags locally)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combines multiple accounts to appear as one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Both have a nice search based interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Right now, the fact that notmuch doesn&amp;#39;t seamlessly delete emails
from the server might be a deal breaker for me. I have a limited quota
at Hunter so I really do have to watch the overall amount of storage I
use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For now, I&amp;#39;m going to start pulling down my email and seeing how I
like mu4e for all my email needs. I&amp;#39;ll probably play a bit more with
notmuch as well and who knows….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s my post and video on setting up and using mu4e:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-39-mu4e/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And here&amp;#39;s the current one on notmuch:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Emacs 63 ClojureScript</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-63-clojurescript/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2020 08:11:52 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-63-clojurescript/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been playing with ClojureScipt for my web projects recently and
really like it. Much more fun than any of the JavaScript frameworks
I&amp;#39;ve used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Still, getting started was somewhat difficult due to the number of
options in tooling and uneven documentation and learning resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s a video that shows how I use Emacs for ClojureScript
development but the focus of the video is on how to get started with
ClojureScript and Emacs takes a back seat other than an example of my
workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the Clojurscript side I&amp;#39;m using &lt;a href=&#34;https://shadow-cljs.org/&#34;&gt;shadow-cljs&lt;/a&gt; which I like very much
along with &lt;a href=&#34;https://tailwindcss.com/&#34;&gt;tailwindcss&lt;/a&gt; for styling. I also mention &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm&#34;&gt;NVM&lt;/a&gt; for managing
node/npm etc. which you&amp;#39;ll also need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the Emacs side you&amp;#39;ll see a bit of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider&#34;&gt;cider&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens&#34;&gt;smartparens&lt;/a&gt; and
you can find my full config at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/dot-emacs.&#34;&gt;https://github.com/zamansky/dot-emacs.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was thinking about also making the following ClojureScript videos if
the communities find value in them and I have time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to create reusable components like an input field with label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a simple Electron app using shadow-cljs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating something with both  server side and client side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also open to suggestions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t pretend to be a cljs or webdev master so please let me know if
I&amp;#39;m doing anything horribly wrong and let me know if you want more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Emacs 62 Magit Forge</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-62-magit-forge/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2019 12:25:58 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-62-magit-forge/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Ever since I started looking at Magit as a &amp;#34;git dashboard&amp;#34; instead of
as a &amp;#34;git interface&amp;#34; it&amp;#39;s been yet another Emacs killer app to me. I
just recently started playing with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/magit/forge&#34;&gt;forge&lt;/a&gt; which allows &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/magit/magit&#34;&gt;Magit&lt;/a&gt; to
interface and interact with git &amp;#34;forges&amp;#34; like GitHub. This allows you
to work on issues and pull requests without ever leaving Emacs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s a video on how easy it is. The video doesn&amp;#39;t show this but the
first time you fire forge up it will prompt you for credentials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, if you aren&amp;#39;t familiar with GitHub issues, check out the
post/video I made a few days ago (&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/git-issues/&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) and you can check out my
earlier post/video on Magit as well (&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-47-magit/&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Emacs 61 - org-msg</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-61-org-msg/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2019 05:00:57 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-61-org-msg/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
By living in Emacs I get a consistent interface across all sorts of
tasks - programming, lesson planning, making presentations, preparing
documents, and yes, even email. I&amp;#39;ve been using &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-39-mu4e/&#34;&gt;mu4e&lt;/a&gt; as my Emacs email
client for a while now. Currently, I&amp;#39;m using Emacs for my work email
and Gmail for personal. I&amp;#39;ve been thinking of going whole hog to mu4e
and possibly migrating from Gmail to a new email provider for the
personal stuff but there are still a few pain points with Emacs email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rich text emails (embedded links, images, etc)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;calendar integration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;contacts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;periodic Maildir sync problems with mbsync&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calendar integration isn&amp;#39;t a make or break issue and contacts with
mu4e is good enough so that leaves two pain points. Formatted emails
which I think is now pretty much solved (see below) and the Maildir
stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the Maildir side, I&amp;#39;m trying deal with my email across four
machines - work laptop, work desktop, home laptop, home desktop. I
originally synced each one separately and that worked but I was having
archive problems - it seems that I was only archiving on the local
machine so if I archived an email at work and I needed to get to it at
home, I was out of luck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then, I moved to sharing my Maildir using Syncthing - an opensource
Dropbox-alike. That mostly worked but if I wasn&amp;#39;t careful I&amp;#39;d get
syncing errors where I have to go into my Maildir directory and
manually rename or remove messages - a real pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If anyone out there has a solution (and &lt;a href=&#34;http://pragmaticemacs.com/emacs/fixing-duplicate-uid-errors-when-using-mbsync-and-mu4e/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; fix doesn&amp;#39;t fully work
for me), I&amp;#39;d love to hear about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s get back to the formatted email. I was already to create an
email in org mode using &lt;code&gt;org-mu4e-compose-org-mode&lt;/code&gt; which I think is
built in to either org-mode or mu4e but it&amp;#39;s limited. It formats
tables, outlines, and source blocks but I can&amp;#39;t easily make a source
block for something like &lt;strong&gt;dot&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;ditaa&lt;/strong&gt; and embed the result. I
found a solution recently. It&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jeremy-compostella/org-msg&#34;&gt;org-msg&lt;/a&gt; - a terrific package that lets
you compose an email in org-mode. It seems to have better support than
org-mu4e-compose-org-mode. It does the basic formatting, tables, etc
and also executes source blocks. The only thing that was missing for
me was LaTeX formatting but I use that so rarely I don&amp;#39;t really care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The package author, Jeremy Compostella, is also very responsive. When
I first installed org-msg it wasn&amp;#39;t integrating seamlessly with
mu4e. It was still workable but I had to manually insert some
configuration at the top of all my emails. I opened an issue on this
and within a day it was fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It also has a very cool preview mode so you can see what you&amp;#39;re
sending. On that, though, I did have an issue but I&amp;#39;m pretty sure it&amp;#39;s
an Emacs / org-mode issue and not an org-msg issue. On my desktop,
when I run the preview, it opens my browser with the email formatted
correctly. When I do the same on my laptop, it runs GitHub Classroom
Assistant - an application I installed and use for other
purposes. I&amp;#39;ve had this happen before with other emacs xdg things. If
anyone else has seen this and better has a solution, I&amp;#39;d love to hear
about that as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyway, here&amp;#39;s a video that shows org-msg in action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I started to work on a web application the other day. It&amp;#39;s nothing
special but if I ever finish it, it will be a pretty complete
project. The backend will be a &lt;a href=&#34;https://restapitutorial.com/&#34;&gt;REST&lt;/a&gt; API and I&amp;#39;m planning on writing
the frontend in Clojurescript. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The problem with developing a web application like this is that you
can&amp;#39;t really write the front end until you have enough of the backend
to provide data. Also, writing the backend would be much easier if you
already had a front end to test it with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Pretty annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What you basically have to do is use some system to make all the API
calls with all the required data. The most fundamental way to do this
is to use a command line tool like &lt;a href=&#34;https://curl.haxx.se/&#34;&gt;curl&lt;/a&gt;. For example, from a terminal
I might write something like this to make a login call:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-curl&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-curl&#34; data-lang=&#34;curl&#34;&gt;curl --data &amp;#34;email=myemail&amp;amp;password=mypassword&amp;#34; https://localhost:8080/login&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It works but is clunky and you end up using the mouse a lot to cut and
paste data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Web browsers like Firefox and Chrome also have extensions (&lt;a href=&#34;https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/5-top-open-source-api-testing-tools-how-choose&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.guru99.com/testing-rest-api-manually.html&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)
but I find them somewhat bulky with their mouse / form based
interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Emacs to the rescue!!!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I discovered &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pashky/restclient.el&#34;&gt;restclient&lt;/a&gt; for Emacs a couple of years ago but only now
am reaping the benefits. It&amp;#39;s really amazing. I can easily set up REST
querries, use all the editing power of Emacs, and even save the
queries for later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I didn&amp;#39;t find this until after I made the video but you can even use
restclient in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/alf/ob-restclient.el&#34;&gt;org-mode&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s all very cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Using Emacs 59 - markdown</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-59-markdown/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2019 11:57:57 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-59-markdown/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Org-mode is my markup of choice. I spend the vast majority of my time working
on text files working in org-mode. Since GitHUb started rendering
org-mode files in their site I&amp;#39;ve also used org-mode for things like
Readme files in my projects. I even force it on my students at
times. When I make an assignment, I seed it with an org-mode file that
they have to modify - that is - fill in things like their names, group
members etc..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That said, sometimes I have to work in plain old &lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/&#34;&gt;markdown&lt;/a&gt;. This is
almost always when I&amp;#39;m working on something collaboratively and more
often than not it&amp;#39;s documentation on a project living on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, given that I have to work with Markdown, time to use some Emacs
magic to make it easy and fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To start, Emacs has a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jrblevin/markdown-mode/tree/f3c54e34cc5228001af36a5301883325319f21d4&#34;&gt;markdown mode&lt;/a&gt; along with a bunch of previewing
and rendering modes. I settled on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/seagle0128/grip-mode/tree/4c7014c8151e522b9dd94f878478087bf92ab10e&#34;&gt;grip mode&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can check out the video to see grip-mode along with some of the
other modes I tried here:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/IlhkYmUU-ns&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/ifram&gt;e
&lt;p&gt;
Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Emacs 58 - lsp-mode</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-58-lsp-mode/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Oct 2019 11:57:57 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-58-lsp-mode/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode&#34;&gt;lsp-mode&lt;/a&gt; under Emacs for a while
now. LSP stands for &lt;a href=&#34;https://langserver.org/&#34;&gt;Language Protocol Service&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is that you
have a standard interface between your editor and some language
server. If you program in multiple languages and each has an LSP
server you end up, in theory, with a simpler configuration and a
consistent interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This certainly sounds more appealing than how we did it in the old
days where you have some ad hoc configuraiton for each language you
work in. At times I&amp;#39;m working or dabbling in a whole bunch of
languages. At times, my Emacs configuration has had separate sections
for each of the following languages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emacs Lisp&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C and C++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clojure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Processing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scheme&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haskell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OCaml&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This can get messy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, LSP sounds cool but when I&amp;#39;ve tried to get it going in the past
I&amp;#39;ve always had troubles. This time, I tried a different approach. I
decided to declare .emacs.d bankruptcy. I cleared out my .emacs.d
directory and started fresh. Not really fresh - I copied over The
critical parts of my configuration to start with - Swiper, email and
org config and a few other things. Then I got lsp-mode working for
Python and C++. Now I&amp;#39;m going to migrate over more of my old
configuration as I discover I want, miss, or need things. We&amp;#39;ll see
how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The new configuration can be found here:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/dot-emacs&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zamansky/dot-emacs&#34;&gt;https://github.com/zamansky/dot-emacs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Using Emacs 57 Dired Narrow</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-57-dired-narrow/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2019 11:57:57 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-57-dired-narrow/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
One of Emacs power features that I&amp;#39;ve never quite gotten into is
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html&#34;&gt;dired&lt;/a&gt;, the Directory Editor. I&amp;#39;ve already done a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-38-dired/&#34;&gt;video on the package&lt;/a&gt;.
It&amp;#39;s really cool and I do use it at times but I still haven&amp;#39;t started
using it for my day to day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Well, I just started using a couple of packages that might change
this. They&amp;#39;re part of a set of dired addons that you can check out at the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks/tree/2c1234592aee91dcd9401bcd67213e6a4a464fd9&#34;&gt;dired hacks&lt;/a&gt; page. The specific ones I&amp;#39;m talkign about are
&lt;code&gt;dired-subtree&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;dired-narrow&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;dired-subtree&lt;/code&gt; is cool but it&amp;#39;s
not the game changer. &lt;code&gt;dired-narrow&lt;/code&gt; is. One of my issues with
dired is that I can&amp;#39;t see all the files I&amp;#39;m operating on easily at the
same time. If I&amp;#39;m marking a large number of files to delete I want to
be able to see all of them at once so I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;m not making a
mistake. &lt;code&gt;dired-narrow&lt;/code&gt; lets me easily do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Using Emacs Episode 56 - Dictionaries</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
One of the great things about Emacs is that it&amp;#39;s not just for writing
programs. Sure, you can set it up as an IDE for just about every
programming language under the sun but that&amp;#39;s just the tip of the
iceberg. I use Emacs for just about all my text processing. This
includes writing blog posts, reading and writing emails, creating
lesson plans and pretty much anything and everything having to do with
text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Emacs has some nice packages that make it really easy to integrate
dictionary and thesaurus lookups into your work flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s a short video showing you how to set things up:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Emacs Episode 55 - Irony Completions</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-55-irony-completions/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Jan 2019 08:27:41 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-55-irony-completions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Last year I put together a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-32-cpp/&#34;&gt;post and video&lt;/a&gt; on some basics of Emacs for
C++ development. In the video I didn&amp;#39;t quite get completions fully
working. I also used ggtags in that video but find myself using
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-33-projectile-jump&#34;&gt;dumb-jump&lt;/a&gt; more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s a quick video showing how to set up &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Sarcasm/irony-mode&#34;&gt;irony-mode&lt;/a&gt; which uses
libclang for completions. It&amp;#39;s pretty slick. Now the only thing I
think I&amp;#39;m missing is header file completions. If you&amp;#39;ve got a good
setup for that, please share.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Emacs 54 Org Tables</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-54-org-tables/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 14 Jan 2019 11:34:13 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-54-org-tables/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
As you know I use Emacs for all sorts of things. In addition to
coding, I use it for email, my schedule, note taking, and much much
more. As part of my job at Hunter, I read and evaluate some of the
Macaulay Honors College applications. I also have to evaluate all the
applicants to my CS honors program. I described how I use Org-mode and
Emacs to help with that &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz-nikola.github.io/posts/using-emacs-44-pdf/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Processing the Macaulay applications
though is somewhat different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was given a list of student names and IDs as well as online access
to their applications. If I wasn&amp;#39;t an Emacs user I&amp;#39;d probably dump the
list into a spreadsheet and go from there. It turns out, Org-mode has
a really nice table editor with just the spreadsheet functionality
that I needed. I had the ability to perform basic calculations on the
data while also keeping the power of Emacs for editing purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Check out the video to see how it all works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For more information, you can check out this &lt;a href=&#34;https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-spreadsheet-intro.html&#34;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; on Org-mode
table formulas and the Org-mode &lt;a href=&#34;https://orgmode.org/manual/The-Spreadsheet.html#The-Spreadsheet&#34;&gt;documentation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Emacs 53 Emailing Org Agenda</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-53-emailing-org-agenda/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 03 Nov 2018 08:55:23 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-53-emailing-org-agenda/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I use both org-mode and Google Calendar for scheduling. I like Google
Calendar because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s pretty universal so I can issue and accept calendar invites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works well with my phone and other mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of my family doesn&amp;#39;t live in Emacs :-(.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer using org-mode beacuse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emacs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer, for the most part, to control my data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I partially sync the two platforms. I&amp;#39;ve already talked about &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-26-gcal/&#34;&gt;syncing
Google Calendar and org-mode&lt;/a&gt;. Right now, I&amp;#39;m just pulling from Google
rather than also pushing up from org-mode because I&amp;#39;m still getting
double entry issues. This means that I have my entire schedule in
Emacs but only part of it in my Google calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To help resolve the problem, I do a few things. First, I sync my
orgfiles on all my computers. I used to do this with Dropbox but am
now moving over to &lt;a href=&#34;https://syncthing.net/&#34;&gt;Syncthing&lt;/a&gt;. I also like to set up a &lt;a href=&#34;http://digitalocean.com&#34;&gt;Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt;
droplet so that I have a single machine that&amp;#39;s always on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve set things up to have that droplet send me an email with my
agenda. It turns out that org has commands to do things with Emacs
from the command line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;org-batch-agenda&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;org-batch-store-agenda-views&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;org-batch-agenda-csv &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can be run from the command line to output a formatted agenda as
a string:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-sh&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;emacs --batch -l ~/.emacs.d/init.el  -eval &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;(org-batch-agenda &amp;#34;a&amp;#34; org-agenda-span 14)&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
or as csv:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-sh&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;emacs --batch -l ~/.emacs.d/init.el  -eval &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;(org-batch-agenda-csv &amp;#34;a&amp;#34; org-agenda-span 14)&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;

&lt;td&gt;20:00-21:00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Note that you have to specify the location of the startup file
(~/emacs.d/init.e;) since when you run emacs in batch mode it won&amp;#39;t
load your normal config by default&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the video you&amp;#39;ll see how I use my DigitalOcean dropplet, set up
with the Postfix mail server and Syncthing to send me an email with my
agenda every morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The command I actually use to send the email is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-sh&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;/usr/bin/emacs --batch -l ~/.emacs  -eval &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;(org-batch-agenda &amp;#34;a&amp;#34; org-agenda-span 14)&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; 2&amp;gt;/dev/null | mail -s &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Mike&amp;#39;s Agenda for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;date +&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;\%A \%D&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; zamansky@gmail.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
which I put in a crontab entry to get it to run every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If people want, I can make a runthrough of setting up the actual
dropplet and SyncThing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Emacs Episode 52 - Eyebrowse</title>

I was originally going to do a video on how I set things up so that I
get an email every morning with my org-mode agenda but that&amp;#39;s going to
be something of an ordeal. I have to create a droploet on Digital
Ocean, set up SyncThing and a mail server and lots of other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ll get to that video at some point but in the meantime I saw &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/9rvboq/what_emacs_packages_have_upped_your_game_recently/&#34;&gt;this
thread&lt;/a&gt; on the Emacs subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It asked about packages people used to &amp;#34;up their Emacs game.&amp;#34; I&amp;#39;ve
done videos on some of the packages mentioned and there were some
packages that I&amp;#39;d never heard of that I now have to check out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of the packages, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wasamasa/eyebrowse&#34;&gt;eyebrowse&lt;/a&gt; was one that I&amp;#39;ve been meaning to play
with for a while. Eyebrowse allows you to easily keep track of
window/buffer configurations. It&amp;#39;s pretty easy and pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s a quick video overview:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Using Emacs 51 - Day to day work with org-mode</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-51-dtd-org/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I can&amp;#39;t believe that I haven&amp;#39;t made a video since the beginning of
summer!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part of the reason is that I haven&amp;#39;t had any video ideas that have
motivated me and the other reason is that the Fall is my busiest
season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any event, here&amp;#39;s the latest installment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Take a look at how I use Emacs and more specifically org-mode for my
day to day work. Sometimes I use the fancy power tools but to be
honest, most of the time, I stick to the basics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The point is that you don&amp;#39;t have to be a real guru to use org-mode to
help you with organization and to increase productivity. Just a few
simple commands and you can accomplish a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I hope you enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
