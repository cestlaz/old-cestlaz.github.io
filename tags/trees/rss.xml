      <description>It&amp;#39;s been 10 days from my last post. Not really a big break for me historically but certainly a big one given how much I&amp;#39;ve been posting this year.  Been under the weather for the past couple of weeks dealing with COVID-19. Haven&amp;#39;t had super bad symptoms and as symptoms have been getting fewer and less severe I&amp;#39;m hoping I&amp;#39;m close to a full recovery.  In any event, I&amp;#39;m feeling good enough for a quick post.</description>
