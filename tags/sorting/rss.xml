      <description>Many teachers are reluctant to try new things. Sometimes it&amp;#39;s a bad case of &amp;#34;I&amp;#39;vealwaysdoneitthisway-itis.&amp;#34; Sometimes it&amp;#39;s not being comfortable with the new way or not having the time to develop whatever happens to be needed for the lesson and sometimes it&amp;#39;s even coming from a good place.  What&amp;#39;s that good place? Concern - if I try this new way and it doesn&amp;#39;t work I&amp;#39;m going to lose some students and never get them back.</description>

      <description>Earlier today I saw a facebook post asking for thoughts on teaching sorting. The question was specifically not about motivations like having the class act out sorts or sort cards but rather about the coding.  I&amp;#39;ve been meaning to write about this since last summer when I attended Owen Astrachan&amp;#39;s talk on the same subject.  Early in my career when teaching sorting I developed the n^2 sorts as standalone routines just as they&amp;#39;re presented in most books but as I gained more experience as a teacher, I changed it up to build the sorts (at least some of them) from existing concepts.</description>
