        Our summer intensive was supposed to be in person but COVID-19 changed that in a hurry. We had to scramble to redesign and figure out how we were going to run things.
 We decided to go with the following:
 Zoom for live meetings  Slack for chat  Git and GitHub
 GitHub classroom for assignments  GitHub repos for code distribution, class website and resource sharing.  GitHub discussions for off hour and long form discussion    While Zoom is a great platform it was lacking in a few areas so we also ended up using:  Padlet as a collaborative writing space for groups Assorted whiteboarding tools.

        I&#39;ve frequently been asked for curricula. I&#39;ll hear from a school or someone otherwise involved in a school or education and they&#39;ll ask for a course they can drop in and teach.
 I explain it doesn&#39;t work that way. A syllabus or curriculum is only so good. A great curriculum with a bad teacher will still be bad but a great teacher can do a lot to salvage a horrible curriculum.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        Teachers always make decisions in their courses - what to leave in, what to leave out. I&#39;ve seen programming and data structure classes where everything is written from scratch and others where a few things are explained and the students just use built in types like the java LinkedList or Arrays.sort() method.
 Do too much from scratch and you&#39;ll never finish the curriculum. Do to little and the students won&#39;t really understand what&#39;s going on and walk a path towards being programmers or coders rather than computer scientists.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        Officially, the last course of the summer was &#34;Modern Topics in Computer Science.&#34; The idea was that K12 CS teachers on the one hand need depth beyond the typical terminal high school course, hence data structures and also breadth so that they could create electives, mix teasers in to the regular courses, or help precocious students with independent or semi-independant explorations.  If someone was teaching this in a typical fall or spring semester course, they&#39;d probably have a list of topics and spend a couple of weeks on each.

        One of our teacher certification cohort members asked for some help on our Slack the other day. It was about a side project - he was learning him so Javascript. It&#39;s always very cool to see teachers exploring things that can help with their craft on their own.
 The whole situation reminded me about how important good tooling is and why, in spite of its popularity, javascript has some severe issues as a learning language and I&#39;m a guy that actually likes javascript.

        We&#39;ve been talking sorting and searching in our teacher certification program and today was all about the merge sort. One of the strategies we use when teaching it in person involves sorting a deck of cards by Tom Sawyering it with the class. It&#39;s fun and it&#39;s effective but you can&#39;t do it over Zoom. What to do? We didn&#39;t want to just jump into the nuts and bolts of merge sort.

 Since this is the inaugural edition of our program and there was no way to really know what the cohort would be like we&#39;ve been adjusting on the fly. This was expected but we&#39;re finally starting to settle in. We&#39;re still finding more zoom heavy days but as we move towards the end of our data structures segment there should be fewer of those.

Don&#39;t get me wrong - I suspect that Fred has the makings of a great teacher, it&#39;s just not what I expected to find. There have been many posts about education but I don&#39;t recall any about teaching or more specifically the art of teaching. I did find this post though which actually speaks to some of the thoughts today&#39;s post got churning.
