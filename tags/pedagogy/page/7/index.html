        div.center {text-align:center;}   Having just concluded almost a quarter century at one job in one place, I've been reflecting on a number of things.  What I accomplished, what I've failed to accomplish, highlights, low lights and everything in between.  I've also learned a lot over these twenty five years.  One thing I learned is DevOps and System Administration.  Back around 1993 or 1994 Stuy wasn't really on the internet.

        div.center {text-align:center;}   SoftDev students are hard at work on their final projects. By now, they all have fairly complex code bases. This limits how much I can help them with debugging.  There are some problems, though, that they have to contend with that even with experience, are hard to spot. Notably because the very tools you use to debug these errors are part of the problem.  Last week, this happened twice.

We just scratched the surface. In class, the kids write pretty nice Photoshop Light applications.  Today we'll look at some more ambitious problem solving - using a Cellular Automaton to find a path through a maze.

        .center {text-align:center;} .frame {width:640px;height:800px;}   We've been using NetLogo in our intro course for years. It's a wonderful programming environment. Many of you recall the Logo programming language. NetLogo is like Logo but instead of programming a turtle, you write a program that's run by multiple, perhaps hundreds of turtles and also by the world the turtles live on.  Some of the reasons we like it are that it's: An easy accessible textual programming language Makes building a graphical interface trivial great for modeling Comes with tons of demo models   And now, with the latest version, NetLogo programs/models can be deployed as web sites.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        div.center {text-align:center;}   The other day, Alfred Thompson put up a piece about coding in multiple languages. Alfred references a post written last May by Rob Underwood.  Both pieces are worth a look.  Rob is trying to illustrate many of the superficial similarities in popular languages.  In the comments on Alfred's blog, both Alfred and I alluded to coding in an appropriate style for the language.

        The StuyCS Family mailing list was host to an interesting discussion today. One of our younger members asked if the practice of giving technical problems during an interview was going to follow him throughout his career or if it goes away for more senior applicants.  An interesting discussion followed.  It reminded me of a time I was talking to a few senior engineers at a large tech company.
