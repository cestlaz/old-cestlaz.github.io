We just scratched the surface. In class, the kids write pretty nice Photoshop Light applications.  Today we'll look at some more ambitious problem solving - using a Cellular Automaton to find a path through a maze.

        .center {text-align:center;} .frame {width:640px;height:800px;}   We've been using NetLogo in our intro course for years. It's a wonderful programming environment. Many of you recall the Logo programming language. NetLogo is like Logo but instead of programming a turtle, you write a program that's run by multiple, perhaps hundreds of turtles and also by the world the turtles live on.  Some of the reasons we like it are that it's: An easy accessible textual programming language Makes building a graphical interface trivial great for modeling Comes with tons of demo models   And now, with the latest version, NetLogo programs/models can be deployed as web sites.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        div.center {text-align:center;}   The other day, Alfred Thompson put up a piece about coding in multiple languages. Alfred references a post written last May by Rob Underwood.  Both pieces are worth a look.  Rob is trying to illustrate many of the superficial similarities in popular languages.  In the comments on Alfred's blog, both Alfred and I alluded to coding in an appropriate style for the language.

        The StuyCS Family mailing list was host to an interesting discussion today. One of our younger members asked if the practice of giving technical problems during an interview was going to follow him throughout his career or if it goes away for more senior applicants.  An interesting discussion followed.  It reminded me of a time I was talking to a few senior engineers at a large tech company.

I attended a talk, given by Alan Alda on communicating science. The talk was sponsored by The Academy for Teachers.

The question he had was "Angular.js or Backbone.js."  Chris and I have had this conversation before. I was explaining at the time why I preferred to use Backbone.

I very much agree that autograders, due to their rigidness lend themselves to less creative projects, but thought I'd write up a few of my own thoughts on autograders.

        div.center {text-align:center;}    We talked about setting kids up to fail in math. What about CS?  Well, it's a little subtler.  I started thinking about this after a conversation with one of my graduates about Harvard's famous CS50. Since that conversation, I've spoken to a number of my kids that have gone through CS50 and most seem to say the same things: They don't really teach anything  The kids rely on a group member who already knows stuff or will learn all the stuff on their own  If it weren't for my StuyCS background my group would have really struggled.
